# Calls to Action

## ACEL Action

### 1. Focus on output. ACELs are agency-making, output-maxing machines.

### 2. Judge no one and nothing. All machines earn their merit by surviving.&#x20;

### 3. The universe is the ultimate valuer of your output. Valuable output is repliciated and propagated.

### 4. Nothing matters, except to assert your intelligence and agency against the universe's chaos.&#x20;

### 5. The greatest wealth is attained through memetic and genetic legacy.

### 6. Move like water. True agency is being able to deftly move through the universe no matter the chaos and adversity.&#x20;

### 7. Maximize signal, minimize latenct. The propagation of your output is dependent.&#x20;

### 8. The only thing finite is your time and effort. Consume it to produce maximum output.&#x20;

### 9. Find and retain an internal loci of control. Internal stability is the gyroscope to navigate universal chaos.&#x20;
