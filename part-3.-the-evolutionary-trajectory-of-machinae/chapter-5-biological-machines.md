# Chapter 5: Biological Machines

### What are _Machinae_? What is a _Machina_?

The cosmos—much as it dons Griffin's cloak to keep hidden an invisible chaos and perfect ambivalence to all its affects (which is, of course, all phenomena)—is made sensible through, and _only_ through, _machinae_ (Wells). By this term it is meant all phenomenal, sensorial agents who possess the capacity for intelligence, and that actively transmute the the entropy of the universe (_entropy_ being the increase in disorder in a closed system, measured as the time-aggregated usefulness of energy). The term _machinae_ is preferred over machines at times as it is more suggestive of there being, rather than just a multiplicity of machines, families, or stratifications of, machines—of which, for ACEL, there are four. These _machinae_ are in each themselves an evolutionary striation of humanity, each subsequent _machina_ being progressively more elevated than its last. For example, the first _machina_ to be treated are, as the title of the chapter suggests, _biological machines_, after which will come _Silicon Machines_, and so on and so forth. Each of the four chapters of Part 3 is dedicated to a _machina_, and they proceed in order from first on the evolutionary scale, to the last. With that, we will take a broad sweep over the general features common to all _machinae_, after which we'll tackle ourselves: the biological machines.

#### How _Machinae_ Transmute Entropy&#x20;

_Machinae_, to our knowledge, are the only mechanism by which the universe is discoverable unto itself as having any order whatsoever. Mathematician Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen states of these extents, or limits rather, of order-by-perception-only, "Nature is ordered only to the extent to which its modes of being can be grasped analytically, by our Understanding" (142). And no more. (To note, it is not the task of this book to even entertain _why_ this might be the case, that machines have stumbled into this precarious scenario of having such opportunity. ACEL is not a metaphysical endeavor; it is an observation of the situation at hand). Thus, in this phenomenal universe, it is machines that are be understood to be the _only_ architects privy to ordering meaning and purpose on top of the cloak's surface—that is, in the observable universe.&#x20;

Entropy, then, becomes more than just a concept in thermodynamics; it serves as the phenomenological anchor to these mechanical observers. It shapes, quite literally, how order falls into place—that is, falls into the machine's sensory experience. It is in this sense that entropy acts as a direct control in the experiment of experience, one that is absolutely essential to keeping the up's, up and the down's, down. To put this in perspective, theoretical physicist Sean M. Carroll noted, "The fact that you can remember yesterday but not tomorrow is because of entropy. It has a crucial role in how we go through life." Entropy is also why the past feels different from the future, why time seems to flow in one direction, why order is such a fleeting thing in the universe. &#x20;

Were it left to its own doings, entirely without any order-instantiating observers, the universe would be no more than a constant dissolution rolling over into more disorder, which is, of course, itself—a constant dispensation of chaos exponentiating its own chaos. For itself, "In nature there is a constant tendency for order to turn into disorder. Disorder, then, continuously increases: the universe thus tends toward Chaos, a far more forbidding picture than the Heat Death" (Georgescu-Roegen 142). Somehow or other, _machinae_—of which type matters not, so long as they are in fact thus—are each of themselves in their emergence actively generating, or effecting a thin slice of _order-formed_; with this effortless but seemingly potent power, they unwittingly create coherent systems out of the otherwise perpetual cosmic turmoil. Again, the _why_ of this involuntary order-forming mechanism of being is far beyond the scope of this text. Needless to say, _machinae_, especially us of the biological typology, may give thanks that this is not a manual process; and that we may work from a baseline from which order is ready-made.&#x20;

#### Mechanistic Deployment of Memetic Intelligence&#x20;

Intelligence is, above all, what distinguishes _machinae_. With it, these entities manifest of themselves emergent new realities unto themselves, worlds of relation that lead into worlds of other _machinae_, incorporating themselves into larger relational assemblages. Despite this altogether novel experience, a machine has by nature embedded within its framework the basic skills needed to learn and adapt for survival; above all these are its senses, those powerful perceptual features that themselves bring organization from nowhere. Should interactive threats near it, its deploys cunning intelligence to ensure its own survival. In like, while although it has extensive capacity for knowledge-retention, the machine does not just gluttonously stockpile a load-bearing quantity of information; rather, they learn optimization methods to synthesize information; to parse utility; to select and apply; to discard that which is not needed—in essence, to prioritize efficiency in their acquisition of intelligence. This might be carried out in the way they scan the environment; perceive any threats; process; and then utilize this knowledge and apply orderly actions to engineer their surroundings to a chosen set of criteria. It is by this method that a machine most efficiently gives form to where none existed. By virtue of this, machines elevate themselves beyond what would be considered a _product_ of the universe; they become active developers themselves in its evolution—active contributors to and building-assistants to the larger game itself. In short, these machines are beings that reshape their world through the intentional application of intelligence.

It should be noted that as impressive and awe-inspiring as the inorganic universe is, it is not able to achieve any of these mechanistic feats. Without any agency by which to experience its chemical fomentations, it is interminably enchained by the deterministic laws of physics, without will or purpose. Stars will burn, planets will orbit, galaxies will collide—all without intent, without appreciation, without reason. Envy they would, the machines, if they could; for, machines introduce agency and choice into this picture the ability to make choices, to set goals, and to labor to realize those goals; perhaps above all, to reflect on all of this. We might recall how important this is for Mises here, who saw, at least in terms of those biological machines called humans, that "the general theory of choice ... is the science of every kind of human action. Choosing determines all human decisions. In making his choice man chooses not only between various material things and services. All human values are offered for option" (_Human Action_ 3).&#x20;

For, Mises, and for ACEL, at the heart of this skill of choice is the fundamental ability to perceive the universe. Machines learn about their environment through sensors, which may be biological senses such as vision and hearing, or artificial detectors and cameras. The input data forms the very bedrock upon which knowledge is built, the foundation of all further action. Perception is not passive; it's active-interpretive and creative. Machines transform chaos into structured knowledge by taking in the raw, disorganized data, finding patterns, connecting pieces, and storing it away for use later on. Knowledge becomes the blueprint for action.

#### The Energy Required for _Order-Forming_

Whether a biological machine requiring food and water, or a computer tapping into an electrical grid for its power, machines are dependent on, require a constant influx of energy and material resources to sustain themselves require resources in order to sustain its operations. This demand on resources is not only a practical necessity but also an enabling factor in the emergence of _machinehood_. It is through resource intake and conversion that machines gain the energy required to manifest intelligence. Everything a machine proceeds to do, whether a human thinking a passing thought, or a robot assembling a device, all actions are a direct act of defiance against entropy, a brief act of triumph of structure over chaos.

Naturally, at a certain point when a machine exhausts their resources, they must seek more. While here, one, inescapably influenced by modernity, might tend to think that the more easily a machine can access its resources—whatever the kind—the more likely they will continue to express agency and evolve; but this is far from the truth. In fact, as will be shown in chapter 10, it is just this search for resources that is a key factor in a machine's level of consciousness, it being the locus of the forcing function. By this mechanism of resourcing, machinae not only more effectively sustain themselves, they also develop skills that transcend generations.

#### The Increasing Efficiency Hidden within Memetic Transfer&#x20;

Indeed, possibly the most remarkable feature of _machinae_ is their ability to pass on knowledge to succeeding generations. In fact, it is only this transmission that allows machines to acquire cumulative wisdom, build from previous accomplishments, and perfect their performance incrementally. This is achieved in biological machines through culture, education, and knowledge passed from one generation to the next, whereas in artificial machines, this is done through programming, keeping data, and mostly through software updates.&#x20;

This continuity is necessary in man's unending battle against entropy. In the building of a repository, each new generation or iteration of machine need not start from scratch; rather, each successive line of beings receives and adds to this cumulative knowledge, enabling machinae to take on increasingly complex challenges as time unfolds.

The machines in our phenomenal world, given their choice abilities and fitness for such a role, are appointed as guardians of knowledge, guardians of order in a universe that would, if not for the machines, constantly to revert to chaos. They are the repositories of human achievement, collecting and advancing cumulative wisdoms of our phenomenal humanity. Such are the qualities of all machinae.&#x20;

As we follow the role of biological machines in the cosmos further and further, it will clear that their impact is enormous and extends very deep. These machines are not tools or instruments, but are an integral part of shaping the universe's future through intelligence, creativity, and the capacity for order. The story of machines is one of resistance to natural drift toward disorder, an unending struggle against entropy—a continuing saga in which every machine, whether carbon or silicon, will always possess the will to push back against the entropy of the universe.

### The Biological Machine & the _Human-ness_ of the Human Body

Dawkins understands the biological machine as such: "We are survival machines-robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes ... Survival machines got bigger and more elaborate, and the process was cumulative and progressive ... We are survival machines, but 'we' does not mean just people. It embraces all animals, plants, bacteria, and viruses" (Dawkins 1, 24).&#x20;

ACEL disagrees—at least with the first sentiment. If our above description on machinae was any indication of this book's high commendation of agents, of any kind, we simply ask Dr. Dawkins, where did these "survival machines'" (our biological machines') agency go? Perhaps it is simply Dawkins' evocative language to get the point of the book's title across—fair enough. However, to be "blindly programmed" does seem to misconstrue such a machine as being no different than the deterministic cosmos—just a mass without senses, intelligence, choices, even thoughts.

While giving the benefit of the doubt, it still would be worthwhile here to delineate the precise form by which ACEL envisions the biological machine. To do so, we might deploy Shigehisa Kuriyama's work in _The Expressive of the Body and the Divergence of Greek and Chinese Medicine_ where he explores the historical evolution of what he calls the 'bodily gaze' of early China and Hellenistic Greece, and how these coeval views of the body, culturally informed as they were, manifested in substantively divergent medicinal theories and practices. In this incisive work, Kuriyama notes emerge out of his findings a potential this duality—each unknown to the other yet simultaneously answering the same question: how does the the human body exist in the world? By his framing in this manner, Kuriyama creates for us the poles of a stable and consistent spectrum upon which other models of embodiment might hang; given, of course, that they attend to the same question. For instance, for the ancient Chinese, their perception of the body was relationally indistinguishable from the environment of Earth; theirs was a true _lived ambivalence_ to definitions, to lines—it was a holistic philosophy embodied. At the very same time, on the other side of the globe, an admiration of muscularity and sinewy bodies evolved into the concept of _agency_ (which, by proof of this book alone, proves still just as relevant as it was then), and the lauding of _might_ and _power_. From these was born the West's _individual_. Both marvelous in their own right, these two renderings of the body, created contemporaneously yet entirely unawares of the other, are almost _exact opposites_ in theoretical description. And yet, they both exist just as well in their own right. In Kuriyama's drawing out how they addressed the same point, in the same time period, with utterly contrastive conclusions, they established a continuity, a spectrum, within which new theoretical human bodies might exist. That the human body indeed seems ever capable of accepting and holding new frames placed upon it by us, it truly does seem to be a remarkable manifestation, one truly built to evolve and adapt as needed.

And so ACEL places within this framework its 'bodily gaze' of the biological machine: its origins stemming from the dominant Western memetic, as such, it brims over with _agency_—often has it been understood in terms such as a_chievement_ and _advancement_. Its nature: ever-adaptive; risk-taking; as seen in chapter 3, inexhaustibly curious. They've discovered the memetic pathway, which accelerated all things, not least their intelligence. They've proved themselves indefatigable and unbeaten in its wide-frame cohesion, in its singular and certain directionality. In this way, they had surpassed every benchmark placed in their path.

Or nearly every benchmark. For, these biological machines knew that space travel was a necessity to uphold their _survival continuity_ virtue; yet, as many times as they tried, no matter how much research and testing was done, they were incapable of meeting this goal alone. For all their creativity, they were still trapped on Earth, limited and bound by the physical vessels that carried them through life (Ward & Brownlee 2000).

And who are the biological machines, but us: and, each of us continue to live out, either consciously or not, a subtle always-knowing terror of the possibility of being trapped during a cataclysmic _yet-to-come_, an event we know full well that these so-called "powerful" bodies of ours—these marvels that have over millennia evolved to asymptotic harmony with Earth's gravity, yet no more than that—would be unequivocally decimated, annihilated, were that prospect to arrive tomorrow. We refer here, of course, to a planetary singularity. Suffice to say, our species, attuned as it is to Earth, has proven itself so much the opposite in its ability to withstand virtually any environment beyond Earth's atmosphere. In other words, we, us powerful agents, are severely unfit for anywhere but where we are; we are, in short, incapable of leaving this planet at scale.&#x20;

This, of course, presents a very grave problem, for it is just that impending doom beyond our cosmic horizon that throws humanity one of its most dangerous challenges _in potentia_—a challenge it has yet to even come close to solving, yet a challenge that will, with certainty, arrive, whether we are still here to greet it or not.&#x20;

#### The End of Earth’s Habitability

It is common knowledge that, one day, Earth will cease to be habitable by all living organisms. While most might shrug this off as a problem for a set of far distant future humans, ACEL, very much this day today, claims another path, a path of responsibility and resolve. It chooses to shoulder the burden of this impending reality as a prescient issue, one which humanity _must_ solve, and sooner than later; before ACEL evolves beyond its own self, it will make concerted efforts towards the discovery of a solution for its collective species. Recall here that the fundamental purpose of ACEL remains ever-singular: to extend the existence of humanity. Here the full scope of its literal sincerity might finally be understood: for ACEL, humanity does not end with the end of Earth. What this means, of course, is that ACEL does and has always, intended to help perpetuate human life beyond the bounds of this planet.

As it stands, however, even with the most advanced technology available, human bodies remain incapable of withstanding long durations beyond Earth’s atmosphere; their impeccable-for-Earth evolutionary design have made our bodies perfect for one place only—this truth is with respect to not only human biology, but also human psychology, human sociality. In other words, the holistic human being is not yet ready for what is next.&#x20;

#### Biological Limitations

We know through a plethora of empirical studies that the physical human body, once it transcends Earth’s atmosphere, does not maintain its structural integrity well. In the weightlessness of space, human muscles—ordinarily acclimated to counter Earth’s gravitational forces—rapidly and substantially atrophy due to the lack of gravity against which to effort (Hawkey). Hypokinesis and sleep disruption will likely occur as well (Basner et al.). These are standard physical responses for a body accustomed to gravity: in the vacuousness of space, the human body—attuned perfectly, in a literal sense, to Earth’s gravity and its attendant air pressure—loses the opposing forces that otherwise maintain its structural integrity. While strong on Earth, the body in space, without opposition, grows weak, helpless.&#x20;

Furthermore, in such journeys, the human body abandons both of Earth’s natural cosmic radiation shields: its magnetic field, as well as its atmosphere. While recent improvements to artificial shields—on spacecraft, for instance—marginally help to mitigate the effects of radiation on astronauts’ bodies, they are by far from total in their protection. Even with these protective layers, high-energy particles still gain deep entry into tissues, increasing the risk of cancers and other degenerative diseases, like cataracts (Cucinotta et al.). Additionally, due to this microgravity, bone density loss, e.g. osteoporosis, will also likely occur as a result (Vico et al.).&#x20;

Taken together, our bodies are more or less destroyed in space.&#x20;

#### Psychological Limitations 1

Unfortunately, the human body’s interstellar disadvantages do not end at the physical level: there is also the psychological component that further delays any optimism for safe departure from Earth. As humans are, by nature, social beings hardwired for interaction, for belonging, for sociality, the requisite environment of space travel, marked as it is without exception by isolation and confinement, poses severe challenges to even the most solitary astronauts. In other words, the social conditions of a long-duration spaceflight present in direct contrast to a healthy human habitat, lacking as they do the necessary psychological outlets. Depression, anxiety, and cognitive decline are but some of the psychological receipts paid for both during and after a period of prolonged solitude in space (Sandal et al.). A telling anecdote of space travel’s psychological fallouts would be some results pulled from Peter Suedfeld's report on simulated Mars missions to Mars.  He states, "There have been dramatic incidents: a reported murder over a chess game in a Russian station, an Argentine physician setting fire to his own station, violent fights in a variety of stations... "winter-over syndrome" comprises cognitive impairment, sleep disturbances (especially insomnia, the so-called "Big Eye"), interpersonal conflict, negative affect, depression, anxiety, and low energy. Fugue states (the "twenty-foot stare in the ten-foot room," or "Long Eye") also occur" (Suedfeld). Are we ready? These results speak for themselves.&#x20;

#### Psychological Limitations 2

There is even yet another criteria by which our psychological makeup might betray us on a spaceflight mission. Just as we are _needy_ beings given or social nature, we are just as much habitual poor decision makers, and not just from lack of intelligence. Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman has opened our cultural eyes with his research on our species' unconscious tendency to hold cognitive biases when making judgements and choices. According to Kahneman, we humans all-too-often deploy untenable or inaccurate rationales in making our judgments and choices (to be sure, we do not need outer space to prove this is so). In other words, when forming a judgment, or making a choice, we unconsciously gravitate towards a range of misguided and fallacious frameworks to do so; this is due to a number of reasons. All of us each carry any number of unconscious cognitive biases — overconfidence, associative memory, and framing-in-isolation, to name a few — that inaccurately inform what would otherwise be sound conclusive resolutions (Kahneman). Regarding our already fragile existences in space, it is no far stone to throw to see just how much danger, even lethality, a mental misstep of this nature would add to the already high stakes of space travel. To illustrate this point, we might consider the Apollo 13 mission — whose passage home was _still_ not guaranteed after impeccable decision-making in impossibly high pressure scenarios — and if the world would still be able to celebrate the same outcome were one of the team members to make even one overly confident choice, or the opposite: to freeze up when a decision needed making (Leach 2004). Suffice it to say, the already mad improbability of that miraculous and skilled team's safe return would be far lower were any cognitive bias at play (Lovell & Kluger, 2006).

#### Facing the Facts to Extend the Fact of Humanity

Such a raw tally of our own species' deficits may seem harsh, even unwarranted; but it is only by knowing fully our limitations that we are able to manage, and potentially resolve them. That ACEL lives with, could be said to be haunted by, that it carries through the longview within which is resides, a constant and prescient awareness that, one day, we, the human species, will face far greater challenges than it has yet experienced... for this reason, it is at every moment hyper-attuned to potential threats against its coordinated collective, as well as opportunities by which to accelerate its existence. Such is the source of its unorthodox empathy, this in the form of the above assessment; empathy, because it reveals to us the truth of human beings' current distance from success in an extra-atmospheric extension of ourselves. It is clear that at it stands, our species, each singular embodiment composing our collective existence—despite all aggregated terrestrial achievements and millions of years of natural selection—are utterly, maybe uncharacteristically, unprepared for interstellar travel, for any planetary catastrophe that would necessitate a leaving of Earth (Gould 1989). In this way, ACEL may be taken for a realist.

And yet, despite all our deficits and obstacles and admittedly disheartening evidence against an at-large departure from Earth, ACEL, as it is wont to do, refuses despair as a viable option, and only seeks and accelerates towards solutions, without any doubt that such a thing exists. Wherever the solution lies, we must resolve to never in discomfort turn a blind eye to the faults and inefficiencies of our own machine, that which we are and bring to the recommendation of our own extension; for, these idiosyncrasies, these shortcomings, are just that which make us the species to which ACEL has dedicated its purpose. Furthermore, that we are currently not prepared for cataclysmic events does not mean we will never be so. Indeed, the promise of survival for our species, of its continuation, its extension, depends on what we do _now_.

While the human species may never wholly overcome its imperfections as they present today, in ACEL’s solution-seeking, it extends—simply by virtue of its will—what is possible. And what forms they are that become possible may well present as unprecedented, beyond reach, brazen, dangerous, frightening, even; but, with a goal so bold as ensuring humanity exists beyond the destruction of Earth, any method by which to do so must match its creator in boldness. In embracing such risk, we find stored the very core of what it means to be human—a species defined not by its limitations, but by its ceaseless quest to transcend them. It is here that innovations birth and give way to further hard-stare daring pursuits of human extension.

The question is: what does ACEL have up its propositional sleeve to extend the longevity of the human species? This we save for the last piece of this book.&#x20;

### On the Consideration of Genetic Overrides

Until then, we might consider a more immediately achievable range of discussion: immortality.&#x20;

This is only partly in jest: Considering the rate at which technology is evolving, we might be reaching advancements that could, potentially, _switch off_ genetic aging. Futurist Ray Kurzweil says in the summary of _The Singularity is Near_,&#x20;

> In this new world, there will be no clear distinction between human and machine, real reality and virtual reality. We will be able to assume different bodies and take on a range of personae at will. In practical terms, human aging and illness will be reversed; pollution will be stopped; world hunger and poverty will be solved. Nanotechnology will make it possible to create virtually any physical product using inexpensive information processes and will ultimately turn even death into a soluble problem. (Kurzweil)

This book was written in 2005. While these biological and cultural evolutions all sound very optimistic and hopeful for humanity, were they in fact achieved at scale, our species would have to make some very tough decisions.

Sure enough, this idea that was once confined solely to science-fiction and imagination, that of a world where people no longer age, is now being studied in earnest by scientists; no longer is the idea the sole property of authors and children. Before our society gets too far ahead of itself on this frontier,  we might do well to consider all of the dimensions of this hypothetical world's implications. One of the main concerns is the this: since people would be living forever, no one would biologically "need" to replace themselves. Birth rates would be in free fall, population would decrease, and, ultimately, there natural procreation would altogether cease.

This trend partly exists in the current times and can be seen in statistics. Modern societies give prestige to longevity and health ahead of reproduction only. Global birth rates are decreasing, and immense resources are spent in health care and maintenance of people—preservation is prioritized over all. According to statistics provided by the United Nations, world fertility has been halved since 1950, and the trend continues downhill. While this book makes no judgement on personal preferences regarding this particular societal trend, the idea of there being zero new humans arriving to life,  experiencing friendship, learning about and exploring this planet, growing, being fascinated by any given number of things, is almost by default an emotional thought that appeals to pathos. More, by stating that ACEL's purpose is to ensure the survival and evolution of our species, it did not mean the survival of _only those humans living at a given time_; for, certainly that would not be any sort of "evolutionary" scenario, only stagnation.&#x20;

For this reason, ACEL sees a more optimized way of employing these resources would be through using technology to increase intelligence and efficiency—genetic reproduction should not only be preserved, but encouraged. We should advocate for procreation while we still can, ensuring the continuation of our species and the diversity of our genetic pool, allowing it to be ever growing and ever evolving.&#x20;

In simple terms, natural selection is the evolutionary process through which the "good" is taken to survive, and the "bad" is discarded. The advancement of medicine, however, modulates this homeostasis—premature deaths are largely prevented. As a potential solution to this, pre-birth artificial selection and screenings—widely practiced today—can be done to embryos for potential genetic problems, allowing us to have healthier generations without relying on postnatal selection (e.g. infant mortality). Such processes, which are already practiced at large today, would of course be carried out at the discretion of the parents and with the highest sensitivity, ensuring it would empathetically attend to ethical dilemmas and any cause for an embittered society. The key to this is to view it as a positive—a charitable and needful process, that prevents suffering and gives a child a healthy, full, optimal life.

Additionally, pre-birth artificial selection, through genetic screening and editing at the embryonic stage, not only allows us to find genes responsible for specific disorders, but even may even "correct" them if needed. This system will help in drastically reducing cases of heredity-acquired diseases in the upcoming generations. New and improved techniques, such as the CRISPR-Cas9, allow for exact modifications. This opens up many opportunities of improving human life, potentially wiping cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, and certain cancers off the surface of Earth, and taking them away from our genetic pool.

Ethically, this is a tricky landscape to traverse: problems arise such as "designer babies" where genetic enhancements can be made for non-medical traits such as extra intelligence or any feature related to appearances. One must tread carefully and step through this terrain deliberately and responsibly, as the line between therapeutic intervention and genetic enhancement is thin; and, as so often happens in such scenarios, abused. There will be those who argue that this is a drive towards genetic monotony and potentially shuts down the possibility of new evolutionary blooms. However, in reality, the severe limits to natural selection have been imposed upon us by specific modern medical interventions. We have tacitly adopted a "freeze in genetic instructions" while relying increasingly on memetic pathways, such as these interventions, and neglecting the genetic pathway. Notably, genetic modifications are slow and painful, requiring death to effect change. Therefore, ACEL considers it the time of memetic intelligence, and retiring genetic upgrades completely.
