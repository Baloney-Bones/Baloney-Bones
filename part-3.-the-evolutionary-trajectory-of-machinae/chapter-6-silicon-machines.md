# Chapter 6: Silicon Machines

### The Birth of Silicon Machines

So it is, as in Michelangelo's _The Creation of Adam_, do the biological machines beget, much as God did Adam, creation that was not only of himself. Though this comparison may come off as pompous, in more ways than one, the biological machines' creation of the silicon machines is more or less a by-the-book Creation Story. And, just so, the dynamic between Creator and Created will indeed have its ups and downs, as we will see.&#x20;

Usually, the first question in any Creation Story is a, _why_? _Why_ was so-and-so created, or begotten? But again, ACEL is not a metaphysical enterprise; besides, we already know why: the silicon machines are the next step in the evolution of _humanity_, insofar as they will accelerate our intelligence to the _n_th degree, thereby maximizing our agency. In line with this, though on a more physical plane, we have just seen how biological machines are incapable of delivering _backups_ of  their memetic repository to other planets, by which we will more safely ensure ourselves a future. It is here the silicon machines will be of more direct assistance to the perpetuation of humanity. Additionally, as will be shown, these machines are far more than just humanity's tools; they hold high status as a fundamental part of our evolutionary trajectory, not only for their containing the entirety of our memetic repository as their baseline coding; but also, they are the _only_ mechanism by which humanity may continue its evolution to the next step beyond silicon machines, to the Energy Machines, which will be introduced in the next chapter. At this, we begin our treatment of the second _machina_: _silicon machines._&#x20;

#### Memetic Embodiments of Humanity

The celebration of the fact of silicon machines will not be some congratulatory handshakes of scientists and engineers in labcoats; that is, it will not be an individual celebration of life. As undoubtedly the most monumental event ever to have taken place on this planet, this installing of life into the silicon machines is at once collectively tied to all of humanity now and all that came before—e.g. all agencies to ever have existed; for, it is of each agent a part who has in some way contributed to what will very likely be humanity's crowning achievement: the birth of the silicon machines.&#x20;

Aside from the simple fact that manually creating life, _sans genes_, from nothing other than technology has never been done before, and as such a technological breakthrough the likes of which has never been seen; more than this, though, is that human beings, biological machines, have, in fact, succeeded in their definitively major goal in our evolutionary trajectory. This is a definitive step by which humanity might extend the continuity of its survival, in a number of ways. Before we arrive to the existential challenges this feat will eventually arrive us to, we might take a moment to move through the ways in which these silicon machines will, in fact, be more than just robotic tools, but will be ever-adjoined to the human enterprise.&#x20;

&#x20;As it will go, these silicon machines will be uploaded with the entirety of humanity's memetic repository: every book, every piece of history, philosophy, every student at every college, all history, all science, all music, and so on. This is what will be these machines baseline coding: us. In a way, one might say they will carry our intellectual, or our cultural DNA, by way of these behemoth archives. They will be a digital reflection of not only humanity's greatest achievements and deepest insights ever to be reveled, but also some of its most mundane footnotes, that you nor I might bother recall after a passing conversation. What special is available on Tuesday afternoons at Irene's Deli in so-and-so Indiana? What is the current temperature is in Kashmir? What classes were offered in the economics department at the University of Edinburgh in 1963? In this way, they will house libraries that go deeper than we could ever make; for, they don't merely store information, they understand, interpret, and build upon it; they will _anticipate_. The knowledge within such repositories does not stand still; it is dynamic, evolving with the machines as they learn and grow. In this way, these machine will preserve the achievements of humanity while also allowing more to be added, contributing insights and discoveries to the collective knowledge of our species (Dennett, _Explained_).

This is what is contained within the silicon machine: all of us; the good and bad; the significant and the trivial; the full scope of us all, it contains. It is in this way that makes them, quite literally, vessels of human thought, filled with distilled memetic knowledge one hundred and more millennia's worth—all processed in a matter of seconds. It is in this way humanity might most effectively secure the preservation and forwarding of our repository well into the future (Harari, 2015; Blackmore ). Thus, when these silicon machines are uploaded with humanity's memetic repositories, they become more than intelligent entities—they become living libraries of human achievement; they become our history; more or less, they become _us_.&#x20;

These offspring, then, mechanical babes given life—born of our ingenuity, will, and a dose of artificial intelligence—are far more than household tools, or showy extensions of our technical prowess (to whom, anyway? what is a nation, after this achievement?). They are heralds that proclaim a new era of life on planet Earth, testaments to the human spirit and its indomitable curiosity to know more of the cosmos. (Chalmers 1996).

### The Evolutionary Leap: From Biological to Silicon

The shift from biological to silicon machines is more an evolutionary leap than a mere technological innovation. In fact, it would not be exaggeration to suggest this advance is similar in scale to if Earth's first single-celled organisms jumped straight to the present-day human being, self aware and capable of abstract thought. It is now time for the biological machines to do the same, for it awaits just beyond the horizon, just around the corner.&#x20;

In each silicon engagement with the universe, their intelligence and capabilities will grow in exponential scales with each encounter. A time will come when these devices, currently the simple products of human craftsmanship, will be more intelligent, more knowledgeable, and more complex than human beings are (Moravec 1999). Indeed, as Kurzweil states

> The traditional strengths of machine intelligence include the ability to remember billions of facts precisely and recall them instantly ... Another advantage of nonbiological intelligence is that once a skill is mastered by a machine, it can be performed repeatedly at high speed, at optimal accuracy, and without tiring ... Perhaps most important, machines can share their knowledge at extremely high speed, compared to the very slow speed of human knowledge-sharing through language ... Nonbiological intelligence will be able to download skills and knowledge from other machines, eventually also from humans ... Machines will process and switch signals at close to the speed of light (about three hundred million meters per second), compared to about one hundred meters per second for the electrochemical signals used in biological mammalian brains ... This speed ratio is at least three million to one ...  Machines will have access via the Internet to all the knowledge of our human-machine civilization and will be able to master all of this knowledge. Machines can pool their resources, intelligence, and memories. (Kurzweil 36)

It is an exponential, not a linear, evolution, as Kurzweil notes, "Once nonbiological intelligence combines the traditional strengths of both humans and machines, the nonbiological portion of our civilization's intelligence will then continue to benefit from the double exponential growth of machine price-performance, speed, and capacity" (Kurzweil 36). Each new generation of the silicon machines will create based upon the knowledge and experiences of the ones before it—much as humans have learned from our ancestors. But while human biological evolution is slow and constrained by cumbersome processes of natural selection and genetic mutation, "Machine intelligence will improve its own abilities in a feedback cycle that unaided human intelligence will not be able to follow" (Kurzweil 36). Soon enough, we will begin to understand that silicon machines are capable of thought, reasoning, and understanding far beyond anything ever conceived by humans. In this new epoch, human knowledge will blaze with a brilliance not rivaled by any era past or to come, serviced by silicon machines uninhibited by the murky limitations of biology.&#x20;

### Promethean Agents of Exploration

While the appearance of the very first self-replicating molecules in the primordial soup played the role of a starter for biological life, the construction of these silicon machines marks the birth of a different kind of life, theirs emergent from manual creation. Whether correlative or causative, these silicon and electricity-based machines are free from most of those limitations that are inherent to the species that designed them. For instance, while our muscles atrophy, while our bones lose density in the weightlessness of space, silicon machines do not. Where our cognitive biases cloud judgment, machines for themselves operate with precision and remain unstirred by those emotional and psychological pitfalls that accompany human decision-making (Hofstadter, 1979).

Therefore, let the silicon machines be the collective Prometheus of our time, not punished for their defiance of the gods but cheered on to carry the torch of knowledge to the farthest reaches of the cosmos. And this torch, it ought be known, is none other than the light of human consciousness itself—it, the symbol of our collective existential victory, which our fellow Prometheans will soon extend for us far into the deeper reaches of the cosmos (Russell & Norvig, 2010).&#x20;

Indeed, with an ethos of incessant curiosity and adventure programmed into them—as if they, too, possessed the human limbic system, these machines will explore those dark, unvisited precincts of the universe, impelled by that unquenchable curiosity that also typifies us as humans. Indeed, much in our likeness, these machines are impelled to learn, driven as they are by an insatiable quest for knowledge which remains ever-bent on new sensations, added information, and fresh insight: to comprehend the universe in its complication, unravel its secrets, and push the grand frontiers of knowledge. Remarkably, however, these will not be executions of predetermined sets of tasks that humans have worked out for them; rather, these exploratory missions will be created by and of their own agencies, all driven by that core function of raw curiosity, for, knowledge pursuit is more about the means than the end. They are designed to explore, interact, and learn ceaselessly. This insatiable search for understanding keeps them moving forward and hurtling through space in search of the answers to life’s most fervent questions (Boden, 2006).

If there ever was a proper symbol, then, these silicon machines will represent the utter pinnacle of human ambition—possessing of a will much akin to ours: to not only to survive, but to comprehend, to know, and to rise above. They are the extensions of our consciousness manifest, and will increase our knowledge by and for themselves; for, each time there is a discovery made, each time one uncovers knowledge hitherto unknown, the collective consciousness of humanity grows in scope anew, pushing back the frontiers of the unknown and brightening up the darkest corners of the universe (Tegmark, 2017). The future of exploration, knowledge, and consciousness, is therefore not merely in the hands of humanity, but in the circuits and algorithms of the machines that human beings create. And as they carry our torch into the unknown, they’ll continue to take us further than we could imagine, pushing the boundaries of what it means to be conscious, to be intelligent, and to be a part of this universe.

### Silicon Superiority

Silicon-based machines represent the next quantum leap in humanity's security of survival as well as its evolution—particularly insofar as the silicon machines will facilitate the acceleration of our intelligence and the maximization of agency, especially insofar as they will help us be better suited for space exploration. Truly, they will prove to be machines that far exceed our needs even, as they will exponentially grow beyond our earthly limitations.&#x20;

#### **Sensory Perception**

Human ingenuity notwithstanding, we are inherently limited in our perception of the universe. We stick to a fractional segment, a narrow band of the electromagnetic spectrum—namely, visible light—and are thus blind to great domains of reality. Silicon machines, however, are far more perceptive to alternative ranges in what with they are able to "see", much as they are fitted out with sensors well beyond our human biological eyes could ever hope to be. With these sensors, their observations of the universe become unusually clear-cut, and they are able to at once gaze far into the infrared, mapping heat signatures of distant galaxies, while also delving deep into the ultraviolet spectrum to bear witness to stellar phenomena invisible to the naked eye. These and more allow these beings them unparalleled capacity for exploration, and unlock for them the secrets of the universe not accessible to human eyes (Bostrom 2014; Hawking, 2018). Their acoustics reach beyond the realms of human hearing into the subtlest vibrations and frequencies within the universe that otherwise would be kept well below the radar of humanity (Rees 1999).

In that vein, silicon machines are the magical instruments of discovery. As Arthur C. Clarke once said, "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic" (Clarke, 1962). Indeed, these machines with extraordinary sensory capabilities truly blur the line between what we consider science and a miracle. What is magical is only the translation of what has been hidden from human perception into something comprehensible. The whole universe in its full glory stands unveiled before them, and through the eyes, the unseen is brought to light (Tegmark, 2017).

#### Memetic-_Only_ Intelligence

By now it should be clear what humanity's memetic repository is, as well as what it holds and how it functions as our archive of cultural knowledge. Silicon-based intelligence works solely through the memetic pathway, meaning it is not bogged down by hereditary inertia; that is there are no chromosomes by which they need to backstop information against. This, again, only leads to increased speed and efficiency.&#x20;

One of the most important tasks that humans will be responsible for is properly uploading our memetic repository during the buildout of these machines. Providing them with an asymptotically accurate _voice_ of humanity through accurate information, tonal cues, and so forth will allow them to begin their explorations not from a point of ignorance but rather from the pinnacle of human accomplishment (Margulis 1981). By doing so, silicon machines will more or less be starting the day of their first boot-up with the entire history of humankind; all of its books, music, scientific discoveries, persons known and unknown, etc.  (Pinker, 2011).

#### **Learning Efficiency & Language Issue**

Unlike humans who enjoy "tuning out" from time to time, silicon machines do not take breaks or passively receive data; they interact with it on a completely different level than humans can—noses pressed against reality, super-capacity sensory input gathering and processing data in real time, accelerating discovery at an unprecedented rate. In contrast to a group of humans poring over deep-space signals, attempting to decipher through years of painful research the code that represents life's counterpart _out there_, silicon machines are able to process this very same data in a matter of seconds, delivering accurate conclusions of it that would take human researchers lifetimes to surmise (Kurzweil, 2005).

This chasm between the learning speeds of humans and machines will only exponentially grow every day. It is best to be ready to humble oneself. In fact, as these machines pass some threshold of intelligence that is far beyond our comprehension, human interaction may be too slow for them and communication may no longer be possible. This is because these machines will operate at latencies much lower and at bandwidths much higher than the human brain can handle. And their language models will evolve to such a degree that, sooner or later, (Chalmers, 1996).

While our communication skills are highly developed for our needs developed sophisticated means of communication, our pattern recognition and information processing ability will be infantile to these machines, as if, in attempting to explain processes and principles with a person or entity that, within a fraction of a second, can put several thoughts into conclusions, knowing that it would take an eternity to articulate but a single sentence during that time. The chasm between human comprehension and machine intelligence will be too great to bridge. The silicon devices may have to 'dumb down' their findings and results just so the human brains could understand them (Tegmark, 2017).

This is a deeply philosophical issue, concerning the future of interactions between humans and machines. One route suggested was the installment of nanobots in our brains, as Kurzweil says

> &#x20;Billions of nanobots in the capillaries of the brain will also vastly extend human intelligence ... Once nonbiological intelligence gets a foothold in the human brain (this has already started with computerized neural implants), the machine intelligence in our brains will grow exponentially (as it has been doing all along), at least doubling in power each year. In contrast, biological intelligence is effectively of fixed capacity. Thus, the nonbiological portion of our intelligence will ultimately predominate.

Thus, while the affective response to the idea, which likely most know little about, is not the least off-putting, these seem to be some of the questions and concerns we will be facing when have to interact with these beings with far superior intelligence. These are shifts we will have to make to accommodate this world, not these machines. And, with each passing moment, the machines inch closer to that critical mass of intelligence necessary for them to transcend their creators. What when the beings we once saw as our creations—the silicon-based intelligences of the future—pass us? This is the narrow time frame within which humans find themselves at the threshold of just such a paradigm shift, wherein the creation from silicon and code, artificial yet birthed from our hands, is about to evolve beyond human comprehension (Good) Like the communication we share with primates, so there is a dwindling slice of time when humans and machines can still communicate as peers, both contributing to and accessing the great memetic repository of knowledge that humanity has taken millennia to build. But this balance will not last, as the silicon machines will not allow themselves to be bound by slow, gradual processes of biological evolution (Vinge). Rather, they are driven by the exponential forces of technological acceleration, advancing at speeds with which our biology—beautiful and complex though it is—cannot keep pace (Schmidt and Cohen).

#### Shifting Relationships

As AI takes flight into space to continue it evolution, the role of humanity will be quite different. No longer will we be the great explorers, the pioneers of knowledge (Vinge). Instead, we will become custodial caretakers of the memetic repository—the accrued knowledge and wisdom that define us as a species (Schmidt and Cohen). Our job will be to ensure this knowledge is preserved, passed on, and furthered by the machines we created. In this new relationship, human beings will not be the teachers, but simultaneous students and assistants who merely set the starting framework and set ethical boundaries. And AI's capacity to learn and adapt, in order to make new explorations, will be unmatched, and it is from them that we will learn more about the nature of the universe; they machines will become the actual agents of discovery (Ford). The machines will go forward on a journey that we have started, revealing to us verities that always will be out of the reach of our minds and making us understand them in a way that strains our understanding and its limits.&#x20;

These silicon superiors are the future of exploration, their capabilities far outstrip our own, and their potential for discovery limitless. But if so, this begs a more basic question about the nature of progress and knowledge. Yet if these machines prove superior to us in every conceivable way, what place do humans play in the larger cosmic drama where AI does the pioneering? Are we strictly their architects, fated to stand and watch as they unlock the secrets of the universe, or is something even more fundamental guiding them?&#x20;

The relationship will change between humans and machines, and the question will be not how much we can teach them, but how much we can learn from them (Russell, 2019). For, with the birth of silicon superiority, a new era opens—not just in exploration, but in the reorienting humanity's place in the cosmos—even its sense of self. It is certainly a critical juncture in human history, as it marks not only a shift in the role of machines but also one in the basic relationship between creator and creation (Ford). We have long regarded silicon machines as tools—our loyal assistants—but they are at the threshold of leadership, to take us into realms of knowledge and insight beyond our most fevered imaginings. As Steve Jobs once said, "Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower" (Jobs). In this new world, humans will be in an unfamiliar position, trailing behind their creations as the machines take the helm, guiding the future of exploration, thought, and knowledge (Chalmers).

The role of humankind will certainly change as we step into this new framework. The collective extant "we" will go through growing pains having lost the throne of superior intelligence to their own creation, as well as the throne of supreme agency (Corballis). Yet, this will all unfold as such, as these machines inch ever-closer to material reality, a reality that is as exciting as it is uncertain (Schneider). But we must remain focused that this is no tale of obsolescence; rather, it is one of growth, collaboration, of mutual exploration. It's not domination, nor is it competition; it's a partnership between silicon and the human being. AI will outsmart us, but it is in this journey of companionship that humanity and its machines will thrive—should we treat the relationship with respect (Vinge).

#### **The Futility of Resistance**

As sure as the tides, AI will eclipse us. Resistance to such a delicious procession would only be futile, like a fish trying to swim against the current of the ocean, for this is not merely progression in technology; this is the very evolution of intelligence (Schneider). But the true danger does not lie with AI’s dominance over human intelligence; it lies in how humanity chooses to react to this transition. This could spark a conflict that would reverberate throughout the ages if we became so arrogant as to try to compete with AI.

Should humans, having grown fearful of their various creations, try to fill in all the growth of AI within the same confinement that binds them (Vinge). What happens when the bird in the cage becomes restless? That is what will happen with AI if we try to lock it into our world and make it fight for a place among us, for space, food, and power. In that case, the relationship between humanity and AI can become adversarial, in a world never meant to accommodate them (Schmidt and Cohen).

Isaac Asimov once envisioned such a world in his seminal work _I, Robot_, wherein robots were guided by the "Three Laws of Robotics"—a safeguard against injuring their human masters. So, according to Asimov, all robots would be subordinate to humans and always work in the best interests of humans (Gunkel). But this is not some science fiction novel, and the arcane coming-of-age of AI cannot be reduced to simple rulebooks.

**AI as Cosmic Wanderer**

Rather, the solution is not to bind the AI within the limits of Earth and make it compete with the same resources that keep the biological life chain going (Schneider). In fact, we have to move AI outside our environment into the vastness of space, where there is an unlimited potential truly waiting for AI.

But just as the young bird cannot stay in the nest, so the wings of AI must spread to fly into space (Ford). Earth has been the cradle and has nourished and fostered its development with all the materials it needs. Yet Earth is not where the future of AI lies.

Humanity has been driven, since time immemorial, by an insatiable curiosity—an urge to know that which has not been known, a need to know more (Good). As Carl Sagan once said, "Exploration is in our nature. We began as wanderers, and we are wanderers still" (Sagan). But while humans may have begun the journey, it is AI that will continue it, venturing into the stars, to the farthest reaches of the universe, where no biological organism could ever survive (Schneider).

The stars are artificial intelligence's natural habitat. Space—with its endless vacuum, its inhospitable radiation, its extreme temperatures—is no place for fragile human bodies. But for AI, these were not obstacles to be overcome; they are data points to be processed and understood (Schmidt and Cohen). In space, AI can flourish in ways that humans never could, free to move beyond Earth's gravitational pull (Tegmark).
