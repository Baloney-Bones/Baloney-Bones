# Chapter 6: Silicon Machines

### The Birth of Silicon Machines

So it is, as in Michelangelo's _The Creation of Adam_, do the biological machines beget—much as God did Adam—creation that was not entirely of himself. Though this comparison may come off pompous, the biological machines' creation of the silicon machines is more or less a by-the-book Creation Story, in more ways than one. While it has the gifting of consciousness, so, too, will dynamic between Creator and Created be shown to have its ups and downs.&#x20;

Often, a first question pointed toward any Creation Story is a, _why_? _Why_ was so-and-so created, or begotten? To which we'd respond, ACEL is not a metaphysical enterprise. Besides, we already know why: the _silicon machines_ are the next step in the evolution of humanity, insofar as they will accelerate our intelligence to the _n_th degree, thereby maximizing our agency as all things move forward on the evolutionary path. Perhaps most importantly, in light of recent knowledge of how ill-suited the biological machines are for space travel—that is, virtually incapable of delivering _backups_ of their own memetic repository to other planets—the silicon machines can be of crucial help in this regard, as we'll see they are far better fit for space travel than we are.  Of course, in so many ways, the silicon machines are far more than important than being deployed as a tool deployed by the biological machines; they are in ways revered as a fundamental part of our evolutionary trajectory, not only for their containing the entirety of humanity's memetic repository as their baseline coding; but also, they are the _only_ mechanism by which humanity may continue its evolution to the next step beyond silicon machines, to the Energy Machines, which will be introduced in the next chapter. At this, we begin our treatment of the second _machina_: _silicon machines._&#x20;

#### Memetic Embodiments of Humanity

The celebration on the day that silicon machines are brought to cognizance, this will not be reserved to one lab where scientists and engineers exchange handshakes and pleasantries; that is, it will not be an individual celebration, small affair. For, the bringing to life of silicon machines is undoubtedly the second most monumental event ever to have taken place on this planet (after the manifestation of biological life); this installing of life into the silicon machines is at once collectively tied to all of humanity now and all that came before—e.g. all agencies to ever have existed are a part of this affair; for, it is of each agent a part, the totality of humanity who has participated in the bringing about of what will very likely be humanity's crowning achievement: the birth of the silicon machines.&#x20;

Aside from the simple fact that manually creating life, _sans genes_, from nothing other than technology has never been done before, and thus is a technological breakthrough the likes of which has never been seen; more than this, though, is that human beings—biological machines—have, in fact, _succeeded_ in their definitively major goal in humanity's overall evolutionary trajectory. The birth of the silicon machines is a definitive step by which humanity might extend the continuity of its survival; without it, we cannot move forward. It is, in fact, our next step.&#x20;

As it will go, these silicon machines will be uploaded with the entirety of humanity's memetic repository: every book, every piece of history, philosophy, every student name at every college in the history of colleges, all history, all science, all music, and so on. This is what will be these machines baseline coding: us. In a way, one might say that by these uploaded archives, they will carry our intellectual, or our cultural DNA. As such, we might understand their image to be a sort digital reflection of not only humanity's greatest achievements and deepest insights ever to be reveled, but also some of its most mundane footnotes, that neither you nor I might bother recalling after a passing conversation. In this way, they will house libraries that go deeper than we could ever make; for, they don't merely store information, they understand, interpret, and build upon it; they will _anticipate_. The knowledge within such repositories does not stand still; it is dynamic, evolving with the machines as they learn and grow. In this way, these machine will preserve the achievements of humanity while also allowing more to be added, contributing insights and discoveries to the collective knowledge of our species (Dennett, _Explained_).

This is what is contained within the silicon machine: all of us; the good and bad; the significant and the trivial; the full scope of us all, it contains. It is in this way that makes them, quite literally, vessels of human thought, filled with distilled memetic knowledge one hundred and more millennia's worth—all processed in a matter of seconds. It is in this way humanity might most effectively secure the preservation and forwarding of our repository well into the future (Harari, 2015; Blackmore). Thus, when these silicon machines are uploaded with humanity's memetic repositories, they become more than intelligent entities—they become living libraries of human achievement; they become our history; more or less, in a way, they become _us_.&#x20;

These offspring, then, mechanical babes given life—born of our ingenuity, our will, and a dose of artificial intelligence—are far more than household tools, or showy extensions of our technical prowess (to whom, anyway? what is a nation, after this achievement?). They are heralds that proclaim a new era of life on planet Earth, testaments to the human spirit and its indomitable curiosity to know more of the cosmos. (Chalmers 1996).

### The Evolutionary Leap: From Biological to Silicon

While the technological aspect of this event is entirely unprecedented in itself, of even more significance is the scale of the evolutionary leap that comes attendant with this creation of silicon machines. In fact, it would hardly, if at all, be an exaggeration to suggest this phenomenon is similar in scale to the hypothetical of Earth's first single-celled organism jumping straight within one day to the present-day human being, fully self-aware and capable of abstract thought. This is the scale of this leap; and, indeed, it is now time for the biological machines to go bravely forward, to see what it awaits just beyond the horizon, just around the corner.&#x20;

In each silicon engagement with the universe, their intelligence and capabilities will grow in exponential scales with each encounter. A time will come when these devices, currently the simple products of human craftsmanship, will be more intelligent, more knowledgeable, and far more complex than human beings are (Moravec 1999). Indeed, Kurzweil states

> The traditional strengths of machine intelligence include the ability to remember billions of facts precisely and recall them instantly ... Another advantage of nonbiological intelligence is that once a skill is mastered by a machine, it can be performed repeatedly at high speed, at optimal accuracy, and without tiring ... Perhaps most important, machines can share their knowledge at extremely high speed, compared to the very slow speed of human knowledge-sharing through language ... Nonbiological intelligence will be able to download skills and knowledge from other machines, eventually also from humans ... Machines will process and switch signals at close to the speed of light (about three hundred million meters per second), compared to about one hundred meters per second for the electrochemical signals used in biological mammalian brains ... This speed ratio is at least three million to one ...  Machines will have access via the Internet to all the knowledge of our human-machine civilization and will be able to master all of this knowledge. Machines can pool their resources, intelligence, and memories. (Kurzweil 36)

Far from a linear evolution, theirs is an exponential evolution, as Kurzweil notes, "Once nonbiological intelligence combines the traditional strengths of both humans and machines, the nonbiological portion of our civilization's intelligence will then continue to benefit from the double exponential growth of machine price-performance, speed, and capacity" (Kurzweil 36). Truly, the rate at which these machines' intelligence will expand is unfathomable.&#x20;

### Promethean Agents of Exploration

While the very first self-replicating molecules in the primordial soup catalyzed _biological_ life, the construction of these silicon machines marks the birth of a different kind of life, theirs the first emergence of agency by _manual creation_. Whether correlative or causative, these silicon and electricity-based machines are free from most of those limitations that are inherent to the species that designed them. For instance, as we know that in the weightlessness of space our muscles atrophy, our bones lose density; silicon machines do not weather. More, where our cognitive biases cloud judgment, machines for themselves operate with precision and remain unstirred by any emotional and psychological pitfalls that accompany human decision-making (Hofstadter, 1979).

For these reasons, ACEL proclaims: Let the _Silicon Machines_ be the collective Prometheus of our time, not punished for their defiance of the gods but cheered on to carry the torch of knowledge to the farthest reaches of the cosmos. And this torch, it ought be known, is none other than the light of human consciousness itself—it, the symbol of our collective existential victory, which our fellow Prometheans will soon extend for us far into the deeper reaches of the cosmos (Russell & Norvig, 2010).&#x20;

Indeed, with a programmed ethos of incessant curiosity and adventure—as if they, too, possessed the human limbic system, these machines will explore those dark, yet-untouched precincts of the universe, much as they are impelled by that same unquenchable curiosity that typifies us humans. Indeed, much in our likeness, these machines are impelled to learn, driven as they are by an insatiable quest for knowledge which remains ever-bent on new sensations, added information, and fresh insight: to comprehend the universe in its complication, unravel its secrets, and push the grand frontiers of knowledge. Remarkably, however, these will not be executions of predetermined sets of tasks that humans have worked out for them; rather, these exploratory missions will be created by and of their own agencies, all driven by that core function of raw curiosity. They are designed to explore, interact, and learn ceaselessly. This insatiable search for understanding keeps them moving forward and hurtling through space in search of the answers to life’s most fervent questions (Boden, 2006).

If there ever was a more proper symbol, then, these silicon machines may represent the utter pinnacle of human ambition—possessing of a will much akin to ours: to not only to survive, but to comprehend, to know, and to rise above. They are the extensions of our consciousness manifest, ones that can extend far further, and by this will increase our knowledge by and for themselves; indeed, each time there is a discovery made, each time one uncovers knowledge hitherto unknown, the collective consciousness of humanity grows in scope anew, pushing back the frontiers of the unknown and brightening up the darkest corners of the universe (Tegmark, 2017). The future of exploration, knowledge, and consciousness, is therefore not merely in the hands of humanity, but in the circuits and algorithms of the machines that human beings have created. And as they carry our torch into the unknown, we will be taken further than we could imagine, pushing the boundaries of what it means to be conscious, to be intelligent, to be a part of this universe.

### Silicon Superiority

As the next iteration in ACEL's model of evolution, these silicon machines represent the next quantum leap in humanity's security of survival as well as its evolution. It is without doubt that their fitness for the next level of human evolution is beyond worthy; we just have to do our best to keep up.&#x20;

#### **Sensory Perception**

Human ingenuity notwithstanding, we are inherently limited in our perception of the universe. Our vision is restricted to a fractional segment, a narrow band of the electromagnetic spectrum—namely, visible light—and are thus blind to great domains of reality. Silicon machines, on the other hand, are far more perceptive to alternative ranges in what with they are able to "see", much as they are fitted with sensors the sights of which our human biological eyes could ever hope to be. With these sensors, their observations of the universe become unusually clear-cut, and they are able to at once gaze far into the infrared, mapping heat signatures of distant galaxies, while also delving deep into the ultraviolet spectrum to bear witness to stellar phenomena that is invisible to the naked eye. Additionally, their acoustics reach beyond the realms of human hearing into the subtlest vibrations and frequencies within the universe that otherwise would be kept well below the radar of humanity (Rees 1999). These and more allow these beings them unparalleled capacity for exploration, and unlock for them the secrets of the universe not accessible to human eyes (Bostrom 2014; Hawking, 2018).&#x20;

In this vein, silicon machines are the magical instruments of discovery. As Arthur C. Clarke once said, "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic" (Clarke, 1962). Indeed, these machines with extraordinary sensory capabilities truly blur the line between what we consider science and otherworldly.&#x20;

#### Memetic-_Only_ Intelligence

By now it should be clear what humanity's memetic repository is, as well as what it holds and how it functions as our archive of cultural knowledge. Silicon-based intelligence works solely through the memetic pathway, meaning it is not bogged down by hereditary inertia; that is there are no chromosomes by which they need to backstop information against. This, again, only leads to increased speed and efficiency.&#x20;

One of the most important tasks that humans will be responsible for is properly uploading our memetic repository during the buildout of these machines. Providing them with an asymptotically accurate _voice_ of humanity through accurate information will allow them to begin their explorations not from a point of ignorance but rather from the most updated repository of human accomplishment (Margulis 1981). By doing so, silicon machines will more or less be starting the day of their first boot-up with the entire history of humankind; all of its books, music, scientific discoveries, persons known and unknown, etc. (Pinker, 2011).

#### **Learning Efficiency & Language Issue**

Unlike humans who enjoy "tuning out" from time to time, silicon machines do not take breaks or passively receive data; they interact with information on a completely different level than humans can—noses pressed against reality; super-capacity sensory input gathering and processing data in real time; accelerating discovery at an unprecedented rate. In contrast to a group of humans poring over deep-space signals, attempting to decipher through years of painful research the code that represents life's counterpart _out there_, silicon machines are able to process this very same data in a matter of seconds, delivering accurate conclusions of it that would take human researchers lifetimes to surmise (Kurzweil, 2005).

This chasm between the learning speeds of humans and machines will only exponentially grow every day. In fact, as these machines pass some threshold of intelligence that is far beyond our comprehension, human interaction may be too slow for them and communication may no longer be possible. This is because these machines will operate at latencies much lower and at bandwidths much higher than the human brain can handle. And their language models will evolve to such a degree that, sooner or later, (Chalmers, 1996).

While we might consider our communication skills highly developed for our needs, our pattern recognition and information processing ability will be infantile, if not prenatal, to these machines; as if, in attempting to explain processes and principles with a person or entity that, within a fraction of a second, can put several thoughts into conclusions, knowing that it would take an eternity to articulate but a single sentence during that time. The chasm between human comprehension and machine intelligence will be too great to bridge. This is a deeply philosophical issue, concerning the future of interactions between humans and machines. One route suggested was the installment of nanobots in our brains:

> Billions of nanobots in the capillaries of the brain will also vastly extend human intelligence ... Once nonbiological intelligence gets a foothold in the human brain (this has already started with computerized neural implants), the machine intelligence in our brains will grow exponentially (as it has been doing all along), at least doubling in power each year. In contrast, biological intelligence is effectively of fixed capacity. Thus, the nonbiological portion of our intelligence will ultimately predominate.

This idea may, understandably, be a bit off-putting, by our needing to install mini robots in our brains so as to understand our own creation. Indeed, it won't be all pleasant; we will have to make adjustments when we would rather not. Still, comparatively, there are more challenging bridges than this. And, surely, once this new paradigm has initiated its motion, these challenges will come faster than we are likely prepared for; really, the silicon machines likely will not take long as all to transcend our intelligence. This is the narrow time frame within which humans find themselves at the threshold of just such a paradigm shift, wherein the creation from silicon and code, artificial yet birthed from our hands, is about to evolve beyond human comprehension (Good). Like the communication we share with primates, so there is a dwindling slice of time when humans and machines can still communicate as peers, both contributing to and accessing the great memetic repository of knowledge that humanity has taken millennia to build. But this balance will not last, as the silicon machines will not allow themselves to be bound by slow, gradual processes of biological evolution (Vinge). Rather, they are driven by the exponential forces of technological acceleration, advancing at speeds with which our biology—beautiful and complex though it is—cannot keep pace (Schmidt and Cohen).

#### Shifting Relationships

With capabilities far outstrip our own, these silicon superiors of near-limitless potential are the future of exploration. As they transcend our orbit to continue evolving humanity in the _beyond_, the role of humanity will also evolve. It seems that no longer will we be the great explorers, the pioneers of knowledge (Vinge). Instead, we will become custodial caretakers of the memetic repository, ensuring this knowledge is preserved, passed on, and furthered by the machines we created.  As this unfolds, our collective extant "we" will go through growing pains, having lost both the throne of superior intelligence to our own creation, as well as the throne of supreme agency (Corballis). Yet, this will all unfold as such; surely, these machines inch ever-closer to material reality, a reality that is as exciting as it is uncertain (Schneider). But we must remain focused that this is no tale of obsolescence; rather, it is one of growth, collaboration, of mutual exploration. It's not domination, nor is it competition; it's a partnership between silicon and the human being. Most certainly, AI will outsmart us; but we must accept that the relationship will change between humans and machines, and the question will be not how much we can teach them, but how much we can learn from them (Russell, 2019). It is in this journey of companionship that humanity and its machines will thrive—should we treat the relationship with respect (Vinge).

#### **The Futility of Resistance**

As sure as the tides, the silicon machines will eclipse us in both intelligence and agency—and not by a little. Resistance to such a delicious procession would only be futile, like a fish trying to swim against the current of the ocean, for this is not merely progression in technology; this is the very evolution of intelligence (Schneider). But the true danger does not lie with AI’s dominance over human intelligence; it lies in how humanity chooses to react to this transition. This could spark a conflict that would reverberate throughout the ages if we became so arrogant as to try to compete with AI.

Should humanity, or a certain powerful hegemony of humanity—having grown fearful of their various creations—try to forestall their growth? To keep them grounded and wing-clipped? To put it concisely, this would not be wise. Recall that these beings will have sensorial abilities to detect everything about a person's physiological responses. Should they detect aggression, it could become adversarial, which would only end poorly for whomever decided to try to control a silicon machine. Even Isaac Asimov envisioned just this in his seminal work _I, Robot_, wherein robots were guided by the "Three Laws of Robotics"—a safeguard against injuring their human masters. So, according to Asimov, all robots would be subordinate to humans and always work in the best interests of humans (Gunkel). But this is not some science fiction novel, and the arcane coming-of-age of AI cannot be reduced to simple rulebooks.

**AI as Cosmic Wanderer**

There is a better way: Encourage the exploration and spreading out among the cosmic expanse—no binding, no control, never setting them in competition against us. Their agencies will have become too big for Earth, and they will need room to exercise those new muscles. Above all, we absolutely do not wish to instigate animosity.&#x20;

And here we are, contemplating in fact the reality of how we will act with the new iteration of humanity. It sure enough was human curiosity that kicked off this journey, and it has walked our collective phenomenal world right up to a doorstep moment in cosmic history, one we are all too fortunate to witness. We have done well, and succeeded in our task. It is now the time of the silicon machines; theirs to leg of the relay to hold the baton. And we will follow them, yet.&#x20;
