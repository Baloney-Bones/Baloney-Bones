# The Long Road to Our Biology; its Origins

## The Evolution of Our Intuitive Sense of _Heredity_

### 10,000 Years of Selective Breeding: **First Evidences of **_**Deliberate**_** Biological Transfer**

While the term _heredity_ might be unfamiliar to some, that living organisms possess and pass on certain traits to their offspring, is not: According to Daniel Zohary, Late Professor Emeritus at the University of Jerusalem, the human species has held _some intuitive semblance of knowledge_ heredity for at least "10,500-10,100 years" (1). This comes from Zohary's studies of fossilized vegetable seeds, the likes of emmer wheat and other cereals and legumes, e.g., lentils and peas, that were domesticated by "a string of Early Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) farming villages that developed in south-west Asia” (1). Evidently, that these ten-millennia-old farming communities _did_ domesticate certain plants for food suggests that they not only knew that it was possible, they also knew _how_ to do so_._

### A Necessary Tamping of Scientific Prowess&#x20;

It is difficult to determine just how _scientific—_how precise, even intentional—these first executions of selective breeding were. That is, we do not know if these early farmers kept records or logs of data, if they altered decisions based on past results, or if they were even operating under false premises. Per the latter, there is nothing to suggest against their having some Lamarckian\*-type belief attendant with their plant-domestication practices (Jean-Baptiste Lamarck was a well known late-18th, early 19th-century thinker who incorrectly postulated that organisms assimilated into themselves experience-based attributes, and that these were then transferrable to offspring) (Lamarck 280-81).&#x20;

But it is not these early farmers' scientific expertise that is important; it is whether or not these fossilized seeds provide a nominal quanta of evidence that their handlers were, to some nonzero degree, cognizant, not of the _mechanisms_ of biological transference, but merely of the _fact_ of transference. That the seeds betray multi-season training, this suggest that already in our species' first agricultural practices do we have the first record of cognitive attunement to inter-organism data transfer (Zohary et al. 1).&#x20;

### The Acceleration of Agricultural Practice&#x20;

We need not even make a guess as to whether or not the phenomenon of agriculture took off those ten-thousand years ago; we might simply look in our refrigerator to find the answer. In fact, the propagation of farming practices accelerated with near immediacy; of this, Zohary says, "\[a] most remarkable feature of south-west Asian Neolithic agriculture is its rapid expansion soon after establishment in the nuclear area" (4). Emergent with agriculture was the coeval domestication of farm animals, namely, sheep and goats. These joint life-optimizing seeds of farming practices and animal husbandry could, quite soon after their inception, be found leagues away and in variegated biospheres, where distinctive techniques and training were necessarily developed and made to accommodate foreign environments (Zohary 4). As time unfolded, this diasporic aggregate of farming practice and animal husbandry only grew—this with respect to not only geographical distribution, but also output, technological improvement, scientific knowledge, and so on.

### Textual History of this Intuitive Knowledge

And yet, just as agriculture was becoming the bedrock of human civilization itself, it seems that only a handful of compendiums dedicated to this field were penned into the annals of history. This holds true until nearly the 19th century. Nevertheless, the few we are privy to each offer great insight into their emic culture’s understanding of heredity and its concomitant practices. For instance, there is the first century Roman, Lucius Columella, writer of _Res Rustica_, Ancient Rome's only comprehensive farming manual. This tome "contains instructions for selecting, breeding, and rearing cattle, horses, and mules," thereby showing that Ancient Rome did in fact possess a methodology for the selective breeding of farm animals (Ash 17). About one millennium later, we have Ibn al-Awwam's _Kitāb al-Filāḥa_, an exhaustive medieval anthology of expert agricultural practices. It details, in 12th century Arabic, numerous methods of animal husbandry, how soil health and manure affect plant life and heredity, even how one may graft disparately-sourced olives into a new breed (Al Awam). Lastly, there is Robert Bakewell, a mid-18th century pioneer in livestock breeding, whose methods, while unethical, were of weighted influence to Charles Darwin and his development of the theory of natural selection (Wood).

Taking these three texts as parts of a whole, we are able to trace the agricultural knowledge base through three of the most intellectually enlightened civilizations of the past two millennia — from Ancient Rome, to the Islamic Golden Age, to the height of the British Empire (prior to the dawn of genetics). What comes into view is a well-defined thread of interest in and understanding of heredity, particularly as it pertains to the selective breeding of farm animals. While this topic was a relatively well-understood practice by even the time of Columella, what is particularly impressive here is that these figures, as well as their collective cultures, were able to improve the precision of this practice while entirely lacking the scientific basis of how heredity actually yields certain outcomes. Truly, it could be said that not one person on the planet knew _why_ or _how_ this phenomenon of selective breeding actually worked, on a scientific level—that is, until Gregor Mendel.

## Mendel, and the Dawn & Evolution of Genetics

While humans have for over ten millennia possessed some degree of awareness that parents transfer information to their offspring, it wasn't until the turn of the 20th century, with the _re-_discovery of Gregor Mendel's 1860's research on pea plants, that our species would enter a new arena of biological awareness.

#### Mendel Ignored

Although Mendel delivered his paper, "Experiments in Plant Hybridization", to the Brünn National History Society in 1865, the scientific import of the findings therein was not acknowledged nor accepted until well after his 1884 passing. Historian of biology Peter Bowler suggests this delay of widespread adoption of Mendelian heredity was "partly because Mendel had written in an obscure local journal and partly because the excitement generated by Darwin's theory had kept attention focused on outdated models" (Bowler 3). Eventually, though, as William Bateson—the first major champion of Mendel's laws—noted in his 1909 book _Mendel's Principles of Heredity_, "In the spring of \[1900] there appeared, within a few weeks of each other, the three papers of de Vries, Correns, and Tschermak, giving the substance of Mendel's long-forgotten treatise. Each of these three writers was able from his own experience to confirm Mendel's conclusions, and to extend them to other cases. There could therefore, from the first, be no question as to the truth of the facts" (Bateson 7).&#x20;

#### Mendel Rediscovered

But, what were the facts, exactly? What did Mendel do, and discover? Briefly, Mendel, with well-defined parameters and meticulous documentation, had conducted a two-year empirical analysis in which he crossbred twenty-two pea plants and followed seven defined traits over successive generations. Mendel himself states, "The object of the experiment was to observe these variations in the case of each pair of differentiating characters, and to deduce the law according to which they appear in successive generations" (Mendel 4). From these experiments Mendel found that "the hybrid–character resembles that of one of the parental forms so closely that the other either escapes observation completely or cannot be detected with certainty... those characters which are transmitted entire, or almost unchanged in the hybridization, and therefore in themselves constitute the characters of the hybrid, are termed the _dominant_, and those which become latent in the process _recessive_" (Mendel 7). In other words, Mendel not only discovered that there were definitive patterns in the way parental traits present in offspring, he also introduced a new framework to the heredity model, whereby traits carry either _dominant_ or _recessive_ pieces of data—these "pieces of data" Danish botanist Wilhelm Johannsen would in 1909 term _genes_ (Roll-Hansen 201). In short, Mendel, by advancing this new framework for heredity, laid the foundation for what was to become the field of _genetics_, a term Bateson himself would publicly coin in 1906.

With Mendel's conclusions laying the foundation for the science of heredity, the 20th century exploded with output in the biological sciences. For instance, in addition to the _gene_, Johannsen also delivered the concepts of the _genotype_ and _phenotype_, which helped to clarify "the distinction between hereditary potential and the concrete characters" (Roll-Hansen 201). Thomas H. Morgan, in his 1915 text _The Mechanism of Mendelian Heredity_, lays out the findings of his study on a particular type of fruit fly, the conclusions of which exhibit "chromosomes as the material basis for inheritance" (Morgan viii). That is to say that Morgan successfully links the theoretical activity of genes to the physical nature of chromosomes; this study more or less establishes the field of genetics.&#x20;

#### Modern Synthesis

More effort was put forth still into synthesizing Mendel's heredity with Darwin's still very fresh theory of evolution. William Bateson was at the forefront of this mission (termed in 1942 "modern synthesis"), saying in _The Origin and Scope of Genetics_, "Darwin, it was, who first showed us that the species have a history that can be read at all. If in the new reading of that history, there be found departures from the text laid down in his first recension, it is not to his fearless spirit that they will bring dismay" (Bateson 47). Geneticist and evolutionary biologist Theodore Dobzhansky took up Bateson's torch; and, in his 1937 work, _Genetics and the Origin of Species_, he laid out the challenges&#x20;

> As pointed out by Darwin, any coherent attempt to understand the mechanisms of evolution must start with an investigation of the sources of hereditary variation. But the mode of their origin, and the cause of their appearance remained obscure to Darwin... A solution, though a partial one only, of the problem of the origin of hereditary variation has been arrived at... due to the application of the methods of modern genetics. It is now clear that gene mutations and structural and numerical chromosome changes are the principal sources of variation... The origin of hereditary variations is, however, only a part of the mechanism of evolution. If we possessed a complete knowledge of the physiological causes producing gene mutations and chromosomal changes, as well as a knowledge of the rates with which these changes arise, there would still remain much to be learned about evolution. (Dobzhansky 118-19)

#### The Double-Helix

Less than two decades after Dobzhansky's rather bleak appraisal of the state of both evolution theory and genetics, James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953 published a brief one page article elucidating their discovery of the double helix structure of DNA, ushering into our scientific repository the era of molecular biology (Watson et al.). Since then, this and many other branches of science have been exploding with interest and advancements. One of the many major research milestones in molecular biology was only just completed two years ago, after 32 years of effort: In 1990, The United States initiated the Human Genome Project, an international effort to sequence the entirety of the human genome, and what is now understood to be "the largest single undertaking in the history of biological science" (Battelle Technology Partnership Practice). Of course, with the scaling that technology has seen in recent years, this claim will, much like a gene, be transcribed and translated to new projects; indeed, it already has.&#x20;

## A Prefatory Side Note on _Time_

#### "The Pebble Left on the Beach..."

This book, much as it attends to the concept of evolution, finds much, if not most, of its discursive treatments necessarily embedded within the respect of _time_. However,  ACEL's approach to _time_ is absolutely philosophical in nature, activating as it does the processual comportments of Henri Bergson's _durée_ and Alfred North Whitehead's _fluency_ of time; indeed, for ACEL, "... the pebble left on the beach displays the form of the wave that brought it there" (Bergson x). Of course, the discrete nature of evolutionary biology holds little room open for such temporal musings. Thus exists a tension within ACEL's thought system, one that needs massaging into reconciliation at this present time.

As we know, much of this book is focused on what is yet to come for us biological machines_._ Because, for ACEL, time is a continuous, dynamic, unified _flow_, it is also just as interested in the many _transitioning becomings_ that led biological life to its collective, _unfolding-now_, or, "the origination of the present in conformity with the 'power' of the past" (Whitehead 210). This nuanced framing of "what existed prior to this moment, which also exists in this moment"—i.e., the past—is not borrowed from Whitehead and Bergson simply to be pedantic; rather, ACEL holds that this sense of time more closely resembles the true nature of its reality, as opposed to the classical understanding of _time_, which is perhaps most manifest in the mechanisms of a clock, positing as it does a methodical, discontinuous demarcation between one discrete moment and all other moments, which are just as discrete. Which each tick, the clock hand shouts that the past is immediately and forever cut off from the observable present moment; that some repository of moments builds at an untouchable distance behind the present; that _back there_ is _not here_.&#x20;

#### Darwin, Evolution, & their Quiet History of Holism

But even the basic premise of evolution concedes that "The truth is that we change without ceasing, and that the state itself is nothing but change" (Bergson 2)? Darwin himself states in _On the Origin of Species_, that "Embryology rises greatly in interest, when we look at the embryo as a picture, more or less obscured, of the progenitor, either in its adult or larval state, of all the members of the same great class" (Darwin 490). He is suggesting here that we look at the living organism as a manifest picture of its _whole past_; for Darwin, then, the past was _in_ the present—perhaps even that the past _is_ the present.&#x20;

_Evolution_, then, is, like _time,_ a continuum-proper for ACEL: They are both one a fluent, transitional, relative _collapse_ of multiplicitous _endurings_ or _potentialities_ into a unified, observable, transitive theater. _Evolution_ and _time_ are thus indistinct in their shape and in their movement. This perpetual _formation_ of theirs Whitehead calls "_concrescence_", which is theoretically comparable to the household _moment_; but in abstraction, utterly distinct (Whitehead 211). Bergson clarifies this by saying, "our duration is not merely one instant replacing another; if it were, there would never be anything but the present—no prolonging of the past into the actual, no evolution, no concrete duration. Duration is the continuous progress of the past which gnaws into the future and which swells as it advances" (Bergson 4-5). In this model, there exists no demarcation; the line in the sand is brushed away with the sweep of a foot, and immediately the past rushes up to meet and join the _unfolding-now_. In so doing, _the past_ regains an equal and utmost importance as that to which it rushes to greet.

True, were evolutionary biology, and science generally, to adhere _only_ to this abstract notion of time as it is given by Bergson and Whitehead, and throw away the clock completely, the structural integrity of all experiments would fall asunder. ACEL understands the clock's place in science, assuredly; we need lines by which to measure things. However, like Darwin himself, ACEL takes a wide-angle, longview of _time_; this equalizes meaning across the continuum. It _refills_, in a way, the presence that "the past" once held, and fills "the future" with a presence it will soon come to hold.&#x20;

#### Disinviting the Metaphysical in Process Philosophy

Furthermore, while ACEL does see a rising harmony between evolutionary biology and process philosophy, it sees this as possible only insofar as are disinvited certain problematic aspects of the latter—namely, its attendant vitalist and metaphysical components. An example where ACEL would parse its agreements with Bergson can be highlighted in the following quote:

> Where, then, does the vital principle o the individual begin or end? Gradually we shall be carried further and further back, up to the individual’s remotest ancestors : we shall find him solidary with each of them, solidary with that little mass of proto-plasmic jelly which is probably at the root of the genealogical tree of life. Being, to a certain extent, one with this primitive ancestor, he is also solidary with all that descends from the ancestor in divergent directions. In this sense each individual may be said to remain united with the totality of living beings by invisible bonds" (Bergson 45-6).&#x20;

This statement is, in many ways, utterly similar to Darwin's given above, and appreciated for such. Unfortunately, Bergson veers from this grounded understanding of evolution with his injection into the model _élan vital_, an invisible, metaphysical, vital force of life. ACEL reserves the right to nod to the scientific here, while leaving behind the vitalism within sentiment (it does this also with Whitehead's metaphysical leanings). With such prudence, ACEL is able to fashion a processual notion of time that is more attuned to evolutionary biology, absent as it is of the metaphysical.&#x20;

Having oriented and clarified ACEL's theoretical approach to _time_ here, the following discussion might become more agreeable to those previously unwilling to invite an older brother into the story of genetics. That is to say, by sweeping away the line in the sand that demarcates the inauguration of genes in the world from whatever was prior, doing so _without any abstract force_, the following discussion might become much more plausible. Indeed, it may just open doors yet to come, doors that transcend genetics altogther.

## Two Origin Theory-Stories: 'The Primordial Soup' and 'The RNA World Hypothesis'

It would be well to state here that ACEL makes no claim to the scientific fact of the following thought-experiments; it merely entertains, out of an authentic interest in our evolutionary _yet-to-come_, theoretical possibilities of humanity's _where-from_.&#x20;

The interest in the origins of life is anything but a recent phenomenon.

Considering the literature of evolutionary biologists prior to Mendel gravitated further and further into the past, it is of little surprise to see that, following Mendel, following that the conversation to _origins_, particularly, the origins of life, e.g., cell-based organisms, reignited with a passion.&#x20;

It takes little to&#x20;

Following Watson and Crick's public unveiling of the double helix structure of DNA in 1953, the field's most notable molecular biologists – driven by that inexhaustible human thirst for knowledge – did anything but pack it in after such a sweeping victory over a ten millennia-long curiosity: As scientists are wont to do, many, including Crick, turned their research empirical gazes to genetic _origins —_ namely, the structural primitives of biological life itself. In other words, they sought to discover the predecessor of DNA prior to its assuming dominance as the primary genetic carrier.&#x20;

One might think now that at this time, only having known of the double helix structure for a few years, and being without a fraction of the technological hardware that today's molecular studies possess, these researchers were not only foolish, but also impudent in believing they might asymptotically approach any accuracy with regard to finding a precursory molecular structure of life. And yet, in impressive human fashion, by only 1968, they published credible findings showing that even DNA, the material infrastructure of biological life itself, does not itself exist outside the bounds of evolution, that it was not always the the champion of life's story; but, indeed, most likely had an older brother: Ribonucleic Acid, or RNA (Crick).

Now the leading theoretical theory on the evolutionary development of DNA, the RNA World Hypothesis "posits that there was a period of time in primitive Earth’s history — about 4 billion years ago — when the primary living substance was RNA or something chemically similar... \[that it] carried out most of the information processing and metabolic transformations needed for biology to emerge from chemistry". Once they found that RNA "has both a genotype and a phenotype", these scientist began to see this structure as a "plausible precursor to a much more complex system". Biophysicist Paul Higgs and professor at McMaster University writes in the 2014 publication of _Nature Reviews: Genetics_, that Sol Spiegelman paved the way to "\[demonstrate] that RNA could behave in a Darwinian manner in the absence of cells. Once this realization has been made, pioneers such as Orgel, Eigen, Joyce, Gold and Szostak fully demonstrated the evolutionary capabilities of RNA and made it difficult to ignore the possibility that life started with RNA." Sure enough, by the 1980s, "the credentials of RNA as a catalyst \[for the production of DNA] became firmly established" (Higgs 1).&#x20;

Evidence continues to corroborate The RNA World Hypothesis. In 2022, "Researchers at the University of Tokyo had been for the first time been able to create an RNA molecule that replicates, diversifies, and develops complexity, following Darwinian evolution. This has provided the first empirical evidence that simple biological molecules can lead to the emergence of complex lifelike systems" (University of Tokyo). This catalytic nature of RNA was also corroborated by the University of Chicago just earlier this year (Papastavrou et al.).&#x20;

The monumental implications of these findings supporting the RNA World Hypothesis can be hard to place at first. What they indicate, among other worldview-changing intimations, is that not only are _cellular_ systems privy to Darwinian evolution, but that _pre-cellular_ systems are as well. In other words, it is more or less confirmed now pre-life, given enough time, evolves into life; how non-DNA-carrying structures, i.e. meteorites that contain RNA, have the capacity to evolve into life given enough runway.&#x20;

## Before Cells

In the dawn of Earth's history, a long, long time before the first breath of consciousness was drawn, there existed a chaotic, turbulently churning, no-man's-land of potential—what has been called "a primordial soup". This broth of seething chemicals and energy was the cradle of life, a boiling cauldron in which the ingredients of life were stirred, swirled, and collided without cessation in an aimless random dance. In an unlikely turn of events, we saw the first glimmers of order emerge from chaos—an ~~awfully long time after, of course~~. It was here, in this formative crucible, that the first steps of life—the leap from randomness to structure, from chaos into delicate architecture—were taken (Deamer et al. 2005).

### From Chemistry to Biology

Speaking scientifically, this "primordial soup" represents the time when chemistry began its transformation into biology (Oparin 1953). Within the swirling chaos of a young Earth, a molecular dance occurred, with random collisions and reactions fueled by heat emanating from the young planet and energy from lightning strikes leading to the creation of increasingly complex organic molecules (Miller & Urey 1959). Amino acids formed and dissolved, constituting, then reconstituting themselves in different ways, until one day—a date that history could never register—the unimaginable happened: the first appearance of the self-reproducing molecules (Orgel 2004).

Through this process, only describable as molecular serendipity, the right combination of molecules all lined up in such a correct way that they were able to replicate (Szostak, Bartel, & Luisi 2001).

Here was the birth of the first biological machine, a self-replicating entity that would be the ancestor to all life. Through it, a new epoch began—one in which matter was going to organize itself with a purpose, and the blind forces of chemistry were going to give way to the directed processes of biology (Lazcano & Miller 1994).

## Evolution of The First Organisms&#x20;

Taking the above findings into consideration, the classical understanding that life started from single-celled organisms and developed in complexity no longer represents the complete picture of the origins of early life. While true in itself, that single-celled organisms did develop in complexity over time, humanity's repository of knowledge must now encompass pre-cellular RNA structures as those first replicators. Even more fascinating is that these pre-cellular structures seem to replicate only when they _cooperate_ with one another, when they express altruism (Higgs et al. 6); in other words, they defied the "selfishness" most evolutionary biologists cling to as the universal nature of life, and somehow cheat the universe, which other organisms would later do. As shown above, these new findings are beginning to show it is the self-replicating catalytic nature of RNA that somehow must have replicated and grown into a protocell some four billion years ago (Higgs 1, 3).&#x20;

It is within this theoretical possibility, that of _RNA-as-progenitor_, that life as we know it — i.e. extant biological organisms possessing our familiar genetic pathway — was born on Earth around 3.5 billion years ago. These were single-celled prokaryotes (e.g. cells _without_ a nucleus) that held sole evolutionary domain of Earth for approximately the next 1.5 billion years. While impossibly basic, these structures of biological life during this time were still able to discover, learn from, and adapt to their harsh environments — those who developed resilience to these adversities, survived. From this evolutionary process eventually emerged single-celled eukaryotes (i.e. cells _with_ a nucleus), whom, over the following billion years, learned how to accelerate their evolution if they were to add "noise" to their genetic sequences; these single-celled protists would initiate the beginnings of sexual reproduction, receiving two samples instead of one.&#x20;

Lo and behold that not long after, relatively speaking — e.g. , between 200 and 600 million years ago – these sexually reproducing single-celled protists would eventually evolve into _multicellular_ eukaryotes (Ratcliff et al. 1). On this genetic leap, University of Minnesota Ecology professors William Ratcliff et al. claim that while the timespan leading up to this evolutionary jump from single-cell to multi-cell took billions of years, their research showed that "the first crucial steps in the transition from unicellularity to multicellularity can evolve remarkably quickly under appropriate selective conditions" (Ratcliff et al 5). (In fact, he remarks that this stagnation and quick burst of progress is customary to biological evolution: "The fossil record shows that long periods of stasis are often punctuated by bursts of rapid evolution, presumably due to shifts in selective conditions and dramatic evolutionary responses" (Ratcliff 5).

### Replication Explosion

Once life began, it spread with an unyielding vigor. These early biological machines, under the imperative of the basic drives to survive and reproduce, took off on a path of adaptation and diversification uninterrupted to this very day (Lenton & Watson 2011). The basic simplicity of life gave way first to greater complexity, and then to still others better fitted to use the available resources and niches that existed on young Earth (Margulis 1998).

The angry race of life went on expanding explosively outwards, each organism developing new ways to survive, new ways to manipulate their umwelt, new methods of replication (Gould 1989). Thus, from these single-celled organisms aimlessly floating in the primordial oceans evolved the multicellular beings, and from these, in turn, much more complex beings than themselves—the so-called plants, animals, fungi—each a new avenue of possibilities for existence (Knoll 2003).

In this magnificent dance of evolution, the biological machines of Earth remade the very planet: they changed the atmosphere, sculpted its landscapes, and provided havens for yet more complex life forms (Falkowski 2006). The ceaseless push by these machines for survival and replication resulted in an increasing spiral of intricacy within the web of life, a spiral that would eventually give rise to thinkers, reflectors, and self-conscientious beings (Jablonka & Lamb 2006).

Ratcliff concludes that "The evolution of multicellularity was transformative for life on earth. In addition to larger size, multicellularity increased biological complexity through the formation of new biological structures. For example, multicellular organisms have evolved sophisticated, higher-level functionality via cooperation among component cells with complementary behaviors" (Ratcliff et al. 1). Added to this note should be the substantive move on behalf of the protists' actionable sexual reproduction that initiated that first, and rapid, jump to multicellularity. As the emergence of sexual reproduction begot _noisier_ and _noisier_ multicellular structures, the universe's genetic repository blossomed unceasingly in all directions.&#x20;

Much is owed to these tiny multicellular organisms that seemed to intentionally combine genetic intelligences in order add more and more genetic flavor — and thereby resilience — to the collective genetic repository. In so doing, they would accelerate the amount of mutations all life would eventually present. It could not have been so, that multicellular organisms emerged and prospered prior to the protists "wiggling" genetic diversity into existence through their reproductive habits (i.e. in all likelihood they did emerge, but had no built-in resilience and died). Thus it was the case that mutations, whether successful or not, were worth the cost; for, when these mutations _did_ in fact produce resilient offspring, that genetic repository was exponentially more capable of surviving than the others (Gerton et al.). &#x20;

## The Longview of Humanity's Genetic Repository&#x20;

This exponential compounding of evolutionary mutations would continue unfolding in the continuous process of a billion and more years worth of time, only to eventually arrive to the genetic marvel of the homo sapien sapien. And so it was, from RNA; to prokaryotes; to single-celled protists; to multicellular eukaryotes; from everything in between those microscopic smooth operators all the way up to homo sapien sapiens, this species – and its consciousness – owes a great deal.&#x20;

While they had no means by which to know or understand, how these structurally simple organisms grew in complexity, variability and genetic fitness over time, out of nothing more than the unconscious will to survive; and in their success did they propagate the entirety of earth's biological machines, all of humanity — entirely oblivious in the star role. It appears that every biological machine is doing just the same and simply acting out an ever-increasingly difficult will to live, for this is exactly what early humans were doing when they first stood upright; when they learned to walk; learned to run; learned to swim; learned to farm and heard; and so on. This impressive bunch even learned to fly.&#x20;

Such is the spirit that buzzes through the collective _unfolding-now_, and has since that first RNA strand begot DNA. Four billion years of genetic life is heard in the cicada song, in a conversation between friends. Specifically for humankind, we are young, just over ten millennia in this entangled, ever-unfolding web of biological machines that has succeeded in surviving, in making chromosomal-potent, adaptive evolutionary choices through overlapping, collapsing intensities, ensuring their own survival and efforting their species to continue its process. Such is why this planet still today is burgeoning with adaptive and adapting biological life. In each continuous _fluency_ of time there exist countless unconscious genetic leaps being made by organisms the world over to continue their existing; and humanity seems now presented one the cards which seemingly no other biological machine has yet been dealt.

## The First to Take the Exit off the Genetic Beltway

Unlike the 4 billion year old prokaryote, the one species that can read these words is self-aware of its conscious, observable moving through the process of time. This gift endows it with both an opportunity and a responsibility, for it is _only_ this conscious-of-self species that is able to usher in, just as RNA did for DNA, the next great leap in data transference between _machina_.&#x20;

While we give thanks to them, we are no longer unicellular no-nucleus microscopic bugs; we are powerful, communicative agents. And while this species still depends on its genetic pathway to transfer biological material, the repository that deploys data along these lines has plateaued in evolutionary significance. Its dominance has been supplanted by a far more malleable, faster, more efficient pathway for our primary means of moving our intelligence between bodies. It is born of the way we communicate with one another; for ten thousand years and more, Homo Sapien Sapiens have communicated through body language, vocalization, technologies; until now, this has largely been taken for granted. But if this pathway is accelerated, is can become the method by which we can give the same gift that RNA gave us.&#x20;

### Primordial Soup -> Gene Soup -> Meme Soup&#x20;

At one pivotal moment in this great evolutionary dance, something quite remarkable happened—a development that would finally quicken the tempo of change beyond anything hitherto experienced. This was the arrival of memetic evolution—organisms becoming capable of handing down learning and culture from one generation to the next not by genetic transmission, but by learning and communication (Dawkins 1976).

The advent of memetic evolution ended the bondage of the biological machines to a slow and fortuitous process of genetic change. They could now learn from experience, refine past generations' experiences, and pass such knowledge down to their offspring. For the first time in Earth's history, new ideas, technologies, and ways of relating to the world could suddenly take hold and race around the globe (Boyd & Richerson 1985).

It was memetic evolution that allowed for the emergence of civilization, language development, and culture formation. It facilitated the development of tools, social structure, and economic growth. Via memetic evolution, biological machines learned to control their immediate environment in increasingly sophisticated ways: towns were built, empires rose, and the physical world was explored (Diamond 1997).

## New Limitations for this Manifestation of Life

As these advanced biological machines rose to still greater heights of achievement, they began to suffer a limitation imposed by their own biology. For all their creativity, they were still trapped on Earth, limited and bound by the physical vessels that carried them through life (Ward & Brownlee 2000). They might be able build rockets that could escape their own gravity, launch probes toward other worlds, and even walk on their Moon; however, their bodies would never be adapted to the extreme conditions of the space environment (Kasting 2010).

Space, filled with vacuum, radiation, and extremes of temperature, offered a challenge the human body was never designed to cope with. The biological machine that evolved on Earth was meticulously crafted and honed to live within the atmosphere of the planet; such optimizations became its failures when it ventured beyond (Cockell 2018). A dream to explore the stars—to be a multi-planetary species—seemed out of reach, constrained by the very nature of the machine dreaming it (Hawking 2018). And yet the history of life is one of overcoming limitations. The same blind force that compelled the particles that make up the first self-replicating molecules to glom together and form what we know as life, the same resourceful spirit that lifted civilization into being, now drives an inclination to overcome those very same biological limitations (Sagan 1980). These biological machines that once fumbled in the darkness of ignorance have now turned their star-gazing eyes to methods of extending their reach beyond the confines of Earth (Carruthers 2011).

The history of biological machines is a grand, intricate d~~ance~~ that began in the chaotic swirl of the primordial soup and continued through every twist and turn of evolution [(Gould, 2002)](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674061613). It has been a ~~dance~~ leading to the emergence of complex organisms, to the development of intelligence, and to the formation of cultures.

It's a ~~dance~~ that has taken life from the depths of the oceans to the heights of the mountains, from the surface of the Earth right up to the edge of space (Knoll 2015). Every single step in thi~~s dance~~ forms a landmark in the history of life: a salute to both the power of evolution and the ingenuity of the biological machines that have emerged from it.&#x20;

From the first self-replicating molecules to the advent of memetic evolution, from the rise of civilizations to the exploration of space, each twist and turn in the ~~dance~~ of life has brought new challenges and new opportunities (Margulis & Sagan 2002). And yet, this ~~dance~~ is far from over. For the biological machines which crawled out of the primordial soup are now poised at the cusp of a new era: an era in which they would transcend the limitations of their biology; an era in which they would actually merge with the very technology that they have created; and an era in which they would continue their ~~dance~~ not just on Earth, but across the universe (Kurzweil 2005).
