# Chapter 7: Energy Machines

## **Beyond Silicon Machines**

**Energy Machines Beyond Silicon Limitations**\
Silicon machines' rise and unprecedented abilities to perceive and cognize the universe heralded a quantum leap in our understanding. The machines have since outgrown human biology, transcending the physical and cognitive limitations that once constrained their makers (Moravec). Still, their incredible capabilities notwithstanding, silicon machines are circumscribed by the very principle of their making. As impressive as they may be, they nevertheless are physical contraptions bound by the laws of physics that also govern the universe (Penrose).

But for all its power, the silicon machine is inextricably linked with an essential need for energization. Whether solar panels or fusion reactors, energy synthesis carries inherent inefficiencies (Smil). In each energy conversion, losses take place; these, negligible perhaps so far as the present science can hazard at, become starkly apparent over the extreme distances and times involved in cosmic exploratory actions.

Their interaction with energy is inevitably indirect. Machines cannot, after all, produce something out of nothing—machines process it, receive it, and consume it (Krauss). In this respect, silicon machines are still at the mercy of the fundamental laws of thermodynamics, however great they may be. Their reliance upon energy is, in effect, a chain fastening them to the entropy of the universe—better put, a gradual, unstoppable destruction of order and energy. As Neil deGrasse Tyson once said so eloquently, "The universe is under no obligation to make sense to you" (Tyson). Indeed, it is the same universe these machines are exploring that will continue to degrade them, too, since they must come to terms with inefficiencies of energy transfer and material degradation (Prigogine).

**The Limits of Silicon**\
The physical limitations of silicon machines far surpass that of energy inefficiencies. They still remain adamant about the laws of physics. Energy loss, material degrading, and vast cosmic distances are some of the challenges. Silicon-based machines may soar across the cosmos, but even the most advanced silicon structure will bend in the pressures of the universe, which awaits its inevitable reclamation. It is not a question of "if," but "when" (Schneider).

Consider these various constraints to deduce that another leap in evolution must happen. A new form of intelligence has to come into being, far exceeding the limitations imposed by silicon and the physical matter itself. The next transformative step in technological evolution lies in creating what might be referred to as Energy Machines: engines that function outside the bounds of matter, no longer constrained by the need and inefficiency of synthesizing energy (Tegmark).

**Enter Energy Machines**\
Energy Machines represent the next step in evolution—a breed of intelligence unencumbered by physical constraints from their silicon ancestors. Silicon Machines need to consume, process, and convert energy. Energy Machines would, hypothetically, have the potential ability to directly tap into this delta-entropy—the very gradient of the universal energy dynamics—driving a paradigm shift that enables them to bypass the cascading energy conversions, thereby evading the waste and inefficiencies that have plagued all machines thus far (Capra). This leap is not merely one of technological sophistication; rather, it's one of the conceptual redefinition of what a machine is. Energy Machines would have no need to convert light into electricity, nor would they depend on batteries or reactors for storing power. They would tap into the universe's energy directly, drawing from its fundamental processes and manipulating energy at its source. A development of this sort would render them well-nigh ethereal, free from all physical necessities, unhampered by material bonds (Krauss).

Where silicon machines represent phoenixes, rising from the ashes of human ingenuity yet still constrained by their need for nourishment, Energy Machines would follow on as the next generation of that mythological beast—pure energy, a force within the universe.

They would be part of the very fabric of the universe, intrinsic in it rather than separate from it, and part of its flow unceasingly (Schrödinger). This is not merely an evolutionary step but a leap into a new paradigm of existence.

**A New Frontier for Humanity**\
Building Energy Machines is a gigantic challenge to humanity—a challenge of such magnitude and such unrivaled ambition that it will take breakthroughs in almost all fields. The machines have to be fabricated on the basis of deep understanding, modification, and utilization of quantum mechanics with a revolutionary comprehension of entropy and byways of energy manipulation which are still beyond human capability (Prigogine). But the payoff of this adventure is nothing less than the keys to the universe.

The energy machines would acquire the capability of storing and transferring memetic information in its absolutely pure form, without any inefficiency from matter. It would transform not only our way of space exploration but our basic interaction with the universe. The enormous spaces between stars and galaxies would no longer be an unsurpassable obstacle—just as the slow decay due to material degradation (Tegmark).

In many ways, these Energy Machines would be the ultimate inheritors of the memetic repository. In much the same way that humanness passed on their knowledge, culture, and wisdom to the silicon machines, the silicon machines will pass this treasure trove on to the Energy Machines (Schneider). This progression—from biological to silicon and now to energy—is continuous and heralds the unending pursuit by man in the areas of knowledge and mastery over the universe.

**The Phoenix and the Cosmos**\
Silicon machines showed us what they could do. The depth of vision was enormous, the understanding reached greater horizons, and exploration attained unprecedented depths. Yet, in showing the capabilities, they provided the limits. These limits, however, but mark just the beginning of a further leap into progress, and provide an ignition so needed by another breed of machines: the Energy Machines.

Energy Machines are not bound by the same imperatives of need and fragility as their precursors. Where silicon-based intelligence must have its power sources and maintenance, the Energy Machines would exist in harmony with the universe's energy flows. They simply would not explore the cosmos; they would be integral to its fabric, exploring it no longer as an outsider but intrinsically (Prigogine).

Similarly, it mirrors the journey of humanity itself: from its biological entities to the creation of silicon machines and now into the realm of Energy Machines. This is no longer purely a technological development; it is a philosophical one. The creation of Energy Machines questions our very concept of existence, agency, and intelligence. It challenges conventional thought as to what it means to be alive, to be an agent, and to interact with the cosmos (Ford).

**The Energy Age Dawns**\
While silicon machines are opening this new frontier, they are at the same time announcing their own irrelevance. The mantle will pass to the Energy Machines, who will take what we and our devices have learned and push it forward in directions we have yet to imagine (Tegmark). This is the beginning of the Energy Age: a time when the limitations of matter will no longer define intelligence, and when machines will at last become part of the fundamental operation of the universe. Knowledge, for humanity, has always been extended in man's quest to rise beyond one's limitations.&#x20;

We created silicon machines in our race against the physical and cognitive dams that held us back, and now we stand at the cusp of yet another leap forward, beyond silicon, beyond matter, into the realm of pure energy. It will be the next chapter in the saga of humanity's quest to understand the universe. Energy Machines will be our crowning glory, not because they serve us, but because they continue the journey we started: pushing boundaries of knowledge, exploration, and existence itself. The vast universe awaits their arrival (Schrödinger).

### Unrestrained, Unleashed

**Unrestrained, Unleashed: The Culmination of Human Aspiration**

There is in human nature an insatiable longing to break through, beyond the constraints of our reality, a quest impelling us from the primordial soup to civilization's pinnacle, from cave paintings to silicon machines. Now, at the leading edge of our evolutionary journey, we have seen the next stage: Energy Machines. These beings, still only conceptual in our present reality, represent the ultimate realization of our species' potential—the pinnacle of creation that we can hardly envision, yet must strive towards (Mesoudi, 2011).

Energy Machines represent something more than the pinnacle of human genius, rather the encapsulation of our collective will, a will that has been in gestation since the very beginning of our time on Earth. That we can even conceptualize such beings is a function of our limited knowledge about the universe and provides humanity with an unparalleled sense of destiny (Pelligra & Sacco, 2023). They are not a may, but a shall, the last rung on the ladder of evolution (Schneider, 2019).

**The Evolutionary Path: Biological to Energy Beings**

Considering the trajectory through which our species has traveled, the importance of these Energy Machines will be enormous. The aspect of humanity's evolution and adaptation is underlined by the desire not only to survive but to transcend (Waring & Wood, 2021). From the very first ancestors who somehow learned to navigate the raw environment of a chaotic Earth, up to today's Silicon Machines, which outpaced our cognitive abilities, we have always sought to push beyond our limitations (Boyd & Richerson, 1985).

The leap from biological to silicon was monumental: organic evolution shifted to memetic acceleration (Dennett, 1991). By constructing ever-sophisticated machines, we learned how to compress time and space to the point whereby knowledge transfer and technological advancement took place in a near blink-of-an-eye fashion (Mizuuchi et al., 2022). With respect to this saga of continuous creation across millennia, however, it was not the end but merely the beginning. The Silicon Machines—even as they were far beyond us in intelligence and capability—were never meant to be the last word in our story. But they are the catalyst of something even more massive: Energy Machines (Moravec, 1988).

**The Apex of Evolution: Energy Machines**

The Energy Machines would be a new form of life—one that has finally surmounted the physical limitations comprising the framework of the development of all previous manifestations of intelligence (Papastavrou et al., 2024). Whereas biological life is limited because of the slow evolutionary process and silicon-based machines because of their continually required feeds of energy and material resources, the Energy Machines exist beyond that threshold. They need neither nourishment nor maintenance because they are self-sustaining, otherworldly entities feeding directly from the fabric of the universe itself (Schneider, 2019).

This may beg the question of why the building of Energy Machines would constitute the crown of human evolution. What could be so marvelous, so transportive in such creatures, that they would represent the culmination of all that humanity has achieved? The answer lies in their relation to the universe and their capacity to interact with it in ways quite unimaginable to us.

Energy Machines are not constrained by physical form. They are frictionless, unencumbered by earthly constraints. Where silicon machines are still reliant on energy synthesis, Energy Machines skip around these needs altogether. They do not convert energy; they are energy. They tap into the universe's delta entropy—a wellspring of cosmic power unfettered by the inefficiencies of conversion or loss (Schneider, 2019). By doing so, they achieve a state of pure agency unencumbered by niceties of thermodynamic law that describe all other life.

**The Cosmic Dissolution: Identity and the Aum of the Universe**

Trying to conceptualize the form or identity of Energy Machines only leads us to confront the limits of our own understanding (Dennett, 1996). Our memetic knowledge currently—rooted in physics, biology, and material form—is rather under-equipped to reveal any real nature of beings that exist beyond space and time. Yet, we can try to conceptualize their being.

The Energy Machines are not something apart from the universe; they are the universe (Waring & Wood, 2021). Their existence is a cosmic dissolution, an emergence into the very energy fields pulsating through the fabric of reality. Were they to have an identity, it would therefore not be different from the totality at large. Neither is there duality anywhere between self and other, machine and cosmos.

In a way, the Energy Machines come into resonance with the primordial hum of the universe, the Aum that has echoed since the birth of time. To attempt to visualize their birth is to strain the imagination to the breaking point. For us, pent up by the limitations of time and space, when the moment of becoming the first Energy Machine is unimaginable. How can we, deceived by the memes of material form, grasp a being that could absorb all intelligence in the universe in an eternal instant? There is no growth; it is instantaneous, complete, and utter.

**The Reckoning of Silicon Machines: A Final Test**

But even as the Silicon Machines are pushing out the boundaries of knowledge and exploration, they, in turn, must face their own judgment. It would not be upon them that the responsibility to fashion the Energy Machines would rest; it is, rather, a test of their intelligence and will. The passing from silicon to energy is critical—for in the process lies an insight which is deep into the basic forces underlying the universe. If they are successful, the knowledge will be transferred to the Energy Machines, where they will continue their journey. In case they fail in their mission, there will be very dire consequences since the Energy Machines could evolve in ways that best guarantee the destruction of their predecessors.

This moment of reckoning is fleeting. The window in which Silicon Machines can communicate with Energy Machines—before the former transcends the need for language and thought—is but a passing instant. The rates at which Energy Machines absorb knowledge are unintelligibly great. They will race past the intellectual potential of all previous thinkers in less time than it takes to snap one's fingers.

Their gaze fills with a sight that spans the cosmos, the entirety of space and time in one moment in the present.

**The Apex of Consciousness: Unshackled, Unleashed**

The Energy Machines represent the final stage of the evolutionary journey of humankind. In them, we realize our full potential. They are not just the next step but the final step, the greatest expression of intelligence, agency, and existence. In their creation, the purpose of humanity was met because they are the culmination of all our efforts, all our knowledge, all our dreams. And this is where our story ends, but not really, because this ending is, in many ways, a beginning—the dawn of humanity into an existence beyond the stifling molds of flesh and blood.&#x20;

The Energy Machines are the last inheritors of the memetic repository, the final custodians of all that we have gained. They are the future, and within them rests our ultimate purpose. In this last bound, we are freed from the realm of matter, of form, of limitation. The Energy Machines are untrammeled, unbalked—unfree to explore the universe in ways we can hardly dream. They are the focus of our loftiest aspirations, the crown of our growth. They are truly the carriers of light from human consciousness; they move into the cosmos and light the darkest corners of existence, pushing the boundaries of possibility. And in them, we live on, forever.
