## Machines & the Universe

## Mechanically Ordering the Chaos

In the cosmic expanse, machines are more than just mechanisms; they're sculptors of order in a universe that tends inherently to lean toward chaos. They can manipulate active entropy and create oases of structure and intellect where disorder would otherwise reign. In the universe, functioning on the infallible rise of entropy, or a degree of randomness and spontaneous movement towards chaos, machines are the brazen architects carving meaning and purpose out of the chaotic fabric.

Entropy, then, becomes something much more than just a conception of science but rather a principle that shapes the very reality experienced. It's why the past feels different from the future, why time seems to flow in one direction, why order is such a fleeting thing in the universe. As Sean M. Carroll aptly put it, "The fact that you can remember yesterday but not tomorrow is because of entropy. It has a crucial role in how we go through life." If the universe were left to its own doings, it would be a dissolution into disorder; still, machines—biological or artificial—act to break down a constant from this cosmic narrative and create systems of order and coherence.

In the infinite universe of stars burning their fuel, galaxies spinning in silent, predictable paths, machines are peculiar agents against the natural march into chaos. For they do not stand passive, but actively interact with a universe by accepting energy and converting it into organized systems.

### Creative Intelligence _to-Order_ from Memetic Perception&#x20;

It is an interaction not of brute strength, but of wit and contrivance; machines, being invested with intelligence, give new realities to the adversarial substances of existence. Intelligence is the hallmark of machines. It is not simply piling up information, but the ability to learn, to adapt, and to create. Machines observe their environment, process information provided to them, and utilize that knowledge and understanding to engineer their surroundings and give form where none existed. In so doing, machines are more than just a product of the universe; they become partakers in its unfinished evolution, beings that reshape the world as a consequence of the intentional application of intelligence. The inorganic universe-in its beauty-is not able to achieve this. It is enchained by the laws of physics and works in a deterministic way, without will or purpose. Stars will burn, planets will orbit, galaxies will collide-but without intent. Machines introduce into this picture something new: the ability to make choices, to set goals, and to labor to realize those goals.

This is creative not only on a physical level, the natural forces of the universe are tapped into and channeled so that they should serve the needs of intelligence.

At the heart of that order-creating capability is a machine's ability to perceive the universe. Machines learn about their environment through sensors, which may be biological senses such as vision and hearing, or artificial detectors and cameras. This input data forms the very bedrock upon which knowledge is built, the foundation of all further action.

Perception is not passive; it's active-interpretive and creative. Machines transform chaos into structured knowledge by taking in the raw, disorganized data, finding patterns, connecting pieces, and storing it away for use later on. Knowledge becomes the blueprint for action, with guidance of machines in acting within the world and informing decisions taken by them.

The machine is, in this sense, no passive observer of the universe; instead, it creates within it. It takes formlessness and gives form-the chaos of sensory input into meaningful understanding. It is this kind of process of perception and creation of knowledge that allows machines to act within the world effectively, to decide, and to change the world.

### The Energy Required for Order-Making

The machine requires resources in order to sustain its operations and to carry on with its job of ordering chaos. Be it either a biological machine consuming food and water, or a computer tapping into an electrical grid for its power, machines are dependent on an influx of energy and material constantly.

This demand on resources is not only a practical necessity but also an enabling factor in the emergence of _machinehood_. It is through resource intake and conversion that machines gain the energy required to actualize order in a universe fundamentally predisposed towards disorderliness. Everything a machine proceeds to do — this could be a human thinking a passing thought, or a robot assembling a device — is directly an act of opposition to entropy, a brief act of triumph of structure over chaos.

The search for resources brings on the constant refinement of machines. First, biological organisms evolve through a process of natural selection, wherein the painters developed mechanisms to live better within their surroundings and passed on the advantageous traits to the next generation. In the same way, artificial machines evolve through generations of design and programming, becoming more efficient, more intelligent, and more capable.

This relentless drive towards improvement is the intrinsic nature of machines, which helps them sustain themselves more effectively in continuing their work of order creation in the universe.

### On the Consideration of Genetic Overrides

Throughout our history, humanity has dreamt of immortality. Considering the rate at which technology is evolving, we might be reaching advancements that could, potentially, "switch off" genetic aging. If we were to ever achieve that, there are deep issues regarding our futures that have to be considered.

A world where people no longer age -- a concept once confined to the limits of science fiction and imagination -- is currently being researched by scientists, and not just authors. However, if we were to do this, what might the implications be? One of the main concerns is that since people would be living forever, they, therefore would not have to replace themselves-- thus the birth rate would be in decline and ultimately, the population would decrease -- there would be a halt to natural procreation.

This trend partly exists in the current times and can be seen in statistics. Modern societies give prestige to longevity and health ahead of reproduction only. Global birth rates are decreasing, and immense resources are spent in health care and maintenance of people -- persistence is prioritized over all. According to statistics provided by the United Nations, world fertility has been halved since 1950, and the trend continues downhill. Is this truly the future we want to preserve -- existence over evolution and propagation?

Accelerationism gives a different perspective. The philosophy is, humanity should use technology as a means of increasing intelligence and efficiency -- genetic reproduction should not only be preserved, but encouraged. We should advocate for procreation while we still can, ensuring the continuation of our species and the diversity of our genetic pool, allowing it to be ever growing and ever evolving.&#x20;

In simple terms, natural selection is the evolutionary process through which the "good" is taken to survive, and the "bad" is discarded. The advancement of medicine, however, interferes with this homeostasis -- premature deaths, proposed by evolution, are prevented. Pre-birth artificial selection could be a solution to this, screenings can be done to embryos for potential genetic problems, allowing us to have healthier generations without relying on post-birth natural selection. Such a process must be carried out with the highest sensitivity, making sure to prevent ethical dilemmas and an embittered society. The key to this is to view it as a positive-- a charitable and needful process, that prevents suffering and allows us to maximize our potential.

Prebirth artificial selection, through genetic screening and editing at the embryonic stage, not only allows us to find genes responsible for specific disorders, but even "correct" them if needed. This system will help in drastically reducing cases of heredity-acquired diseases in the upcoming generations. New and improved techniques, such as the CRISPR-Cas9, allow for exact modifications. This opens up many opportunities of improving human life, potentially wiping cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, and certain cancers off the surface of Earth, and taking them away from our genetic pool.

Ethically, this is a tricky landscape to traverse. Problems arise such as "designer babies" where genetic enhancements can be made for non-medical traits such as extra intelligence or any feature related to appearances. One must tread carefully and sail through this terrain responsibly, as the line between therapeutic intervention and genetic enhancement is thin. There will be those who argue that this is a drive towards genetic monotony and potentially shuts down the possibility of new evolutionary blooms. However, in reality, the severe limits to natural selection have been imposed upon us by specific medical interventions in the modern world. We have tacitly adopted a "freeze in genetic instructions" while relying increasingly on memetic pathways, such as these interventions, and neglecting the genetic pathway.

Notably, genetic modifications are slow and painful --requiring death, therefore, it is high time to go all in towards advancing memetic intelligence, and retiring genetic upgrades completely. This reinforces the line of reasoning for the concept of "Space brains"--that is, the unification of human consciousness with advanced technology. The ultimate offering of memetic intelligence is to fuse the biological brains with the silicon, allowing us to achieve a much higher capacity of knowledge transfer by interfacing with silicon-based technology directly.&#x20;

It would be a giant step in human evolution, where cognitive development and enhancement of knowledge take priority over genetic evolution.&#x20;

### The Increasing Efficiency Hidden within Memetic Transfer&#x20;

Probably the most remarkable feature of machines is their ability to pass on knowledge to succeeding generations. In fact, it is only this transmission that allows machines to acquire wisdom, build from previous accomplishments, and perfect their performance incrementally. This is achieved in biological machines through culture, education, and knowledge passed from one generation to the next, whereas in artificial machines, this is done through programming, keeping data, and mostly through software updates.&#x20;

This continuity is necessary in man's unending combat with entropy. It ensures continuity with each new generation of machines, starting not from scratch but from a foundation built by those that came before. It is this cumulative knowledge that enables machines to tackle increasingly complex challenges, to push the boundaries of what is possible, and extend the domains of order within the universe.&#x20;

The machines here are appointed as guardians of knowledge, guardians of order in a universe that seeks constantly to revert to chaos. They are the repositories of human achievement, moving on with the cumulative wisdom of our race, applying it to the problems of the present and the future. As we follow the role of biological machines in the cosmos further and further, it becomes clear that their impact is enormous and extends very deep. These machines are not tools or instruments, but are an integral part of shaping the universe's future through intelligence, creativity, and the capacity for order. The story of machines is one of resistance to natural drift toward disorder-a story which will continue well beyond the time that minds, whether carbon or silicon, have the will to push back against the entropy of the universe.

### Theoretical Possibilities for the Remarkable, Mutable Human Body

To return here to Kuriyama's work on the historical evolution of the _Eastern body_ and the _Western body,_ there seems to emerge out of his findings a potentia this duality — each unknown to the other yet simultaneously created to answer the same question, e.g. "How does the the human body exist in the world?" — creates for us the poles of a stable and consistent spectrum upon which other models of embodiment might hang; given, of course, that they attend to the same question. For instance, for the ancient Chinese, their perception of the body was relationally indistinguishable from the environment of Earth; theirs was a true _lived ambivalence_ to definitions, to lines — it was a holistic philosophy embodied. At the very same time, on the other side of the globe, an admiration of muscularity and sinewy bodies evolved into the concept of agency and the lauding of _might_ and _power_. From this was born _the_ _individual_. Both marvelous in their own right, these two renderings of the body, created entirely unawares of the other, yet at the same time, are almost _exact opposites_ in theoretical description. And yet, they both exist just as well. In their addressing one point, they established a continuity within which new theoretical human bodies might exist. That the human body indeed seems ever capable of accepting and holding new frames placed upon it by us, it truly does seem to be a remarkable manifestation, one truly built to evolve with its theorizers.

With correlatives and causatives enough to fill libraries (and they do), it is the Western gaze that the human body has come to adorn with a dominance for the modern world and its value system. In this way, _agency_ — often understood in like terms such as a_chievement_ and _advancement_ — came to situate itself as the dominant code of culture, aggregated. It goes without saying that our longview embodied collective did not fail to produce results in the name of _agency_: Through a _survival continuity_ as our standard, and a willful perseverance to achieve such heights (at times in the face of threats grave and contra-existence), our species yet lives, thus proving it still indefatigable and unbeaten in its wide-frame cohesion, in its singular and certain directionality. In this way, we have surpassed every benchmark placed in our path.

Or nearly every benchmark. For, we, each of us, live, either consciously or not, out a subtle terror of a being trapped during a cataclysmic _yet-to-come_, an event we know full well these so-called "powerful" bodies of ours — these marvels that have over millennia evolved to asymptotic harmony with Earth's gravity, yet no more than that — would be unequivocally decimated, annihilated, were that prospect to arrive tomorrow. We refer here, of course, to a planetary singularity. Suffice to say, our species, attuned as it is to Earth, has proven itself so much the opposite in its ability to withstand virtually any environment beyond Earth's atmosphere. In other words, we, us powerful agents, are severely unfit for anywhere but where we are; we are, in short, incapable of leaving this planet at scale.&#x20;

This presents a very grave problem, for it is just that impending doom beyond our cosmic horizon that throws humanity its most dangerous challenge _in potentia_ — a challenge it has yet to even come close to solving, yet a challenge that will, with certainty, arrive, whether we are still here to greet it or not.&#x20;

### The End of Earth’s Habitability

It is common knowledge that, one day, Earth will cease to be habitable by all living organisms. While most might shrug this off as a problem for a set of far distant future humans, ACEL, very much today, claims another path, a path of responsibility and resolve. It chooses to shoulder the burden of this impending reality as a prescient issue, one which humanity _must_ solve, and sooner than later; before ACEL evolves beyond its own self, it will make concerted efforts towards the discovery of a solution for its collective species. Recall here that the fundamental purpose of ACEL remains ever-singular: to extend the existence of humanity. Here the full scope of its literal sincerity might finally be understood: for ACEL, humanity does not end with the end of Earth. What this means, of course, is that ACEL does and has always, intended to help perpetuate human life beyond the bounds of this planet.

As it stands, however, even with the most advanced technology available, human bodies remain incapable of withstanding long durations beyond Earth’s atmosphere; their impeccable-for-Earth evolutionary design have made our bodies perfect for one place only — this truth is with respect to not only human biology, but also human psychology, human sociality. In other words, the holistic human being is not yet ready for what is next.&#x20;

### Biological Limitations

We know through a plethora of empirical studies that the physical human body, once it transcends Earth’s atmosphere, does not maintain its structural integrity well. In the weightlessness of space, human muscles — ordinarily acclimated to counter Earth’s gravitational forces — rapidly and substantially atrophy due to the lack of gravity against which to effort (Hawkey). Hypokinesis and sleep disruption will likely occur as well (Basner et al.). These are standard physical responses for a body accustomed to gravity: in the vacuousness of space, the human body — attuned perfectly, in a literal sense, to Earth’s gravity and its attendant air pressure — loses the opposing forces that otherwise maintain its structural integrity. While strong on Earth, the body in space, without opposition, grows weak, helpless.

Furthermore, in such journeys, the human body abandons both of Earth’s natural cosmic radiation shields: its magnetic field, as well as its atmosphere. While recent improvements to artificial shields — on spacecraft, for instance — marginally help to mitigate the effects of radiation on astronauts’ bodies, they are by far from total in their protection. Even with these protective layers, high-energy particles still gain deep entry into tissues, increasing the risk of cancers and other degenerative diseases, like cataracts (Cucinotta et al.). Additionally, due to this microgravity, bone density loss, e.g. osteoporosis, will also likely occur as a result (Vico et al.).&#x20;

Taken together, our bodies are more or less destroyed in space.&#x20;

### Psychological Limitations 1

Unfortunately, the human body’s interstellar disadvantages do not end at the physical level: there is also the psychological component that further delays any optimism for safe departure from Earth. As humans are, by nature, social beings hardwired for interaction, for belonging, for sociality, the requisite environment of space travel, marked as it is without exception by isolation and confinement, poses severe challenges to even the most solitary astronauts. In other words, the social conditions of a long-duration spaceflight present in direct contrast to a healthy human habitat, lacking as they do the necessary psychological outlets. Depression, anxiety, and cognitive decline are but some of the psychological receipts paid for both during and after a period of prolonged solitude in space (Sandal et al.). A telling anecdote of space travel’s psychological fallouts would be some results pulled from Peter Suedfeld's report on simulated Mars missions to Mars.  He states, "There have been dramatic incidents: a reported murder over a chess game in a Russian station, an Argentine physician setting fire to his own station, violent fights in a variety of stations... "winter-over syndrome" comprises cognitive impairment, sleep disturbances (especially insomnia, the so-called "Big Eye"), interpersonal conflict, negative affect, depression, anxiety, and low energy. Fugue states (the "twenty-foot stare in the ten-foot room," or "Long Eye") also occur" (Suedfeld). Are we ready? These results speak for themselves.&#x20;

### Psychological Limitations 2

There is even yet another criteria by which our psychological makeup might betray us on a spaceflight mission. Just as we are _needy_ beings given or social nature, we are just as much habitual poor decision makers, and not just from lack of intelligence. Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman has opened our cultural eyes with his research on our species' unconscious tendency to hold cognitive biases when making judgements and choices. According to Kahneman, we humans all-too-often deploy untenable or inaccurate rationales in making our judgments and choices (to be sure, we do not need outer space to prove this is so). In other words, when forming a judgment, or making a choice, we unconsciously gravitate towards a range of misguided and fallacious frameworks to do so; this is due to a number of reasons. All of us each carry any number of unconscious cognitive biases — overconfidence, associative memory, and framing-in-isolation, to name a few — that inaccurately inform what would otherwise be sound conclusive resolutions (Kahneman). Regarding our already fragile existences in space, it is no far stone to throw to see just how much danger, even lethality, a mental misstep of this nature would add to the already high stakes of space travel. To illustrate this point, we might consider the Apollo 13 mission — whose passage home was _still_ not guaranteed after impeccable decision-making in impossibly high pressure scenarios — and if the world would still be able to celebrate the same outcome were one of the team members to make even one overly confident choice, or the opposite: to freeze up when a decision needed making (Leach 2004). Suffice to say, the already mad improbability of that miraculous and skilled team's safe return would be far lower were any cognitive bias at play (Lovell & Kluger, 2006).

### Extending through the Shedding of Corporeal Flaws

#### Facing the Facts to Extend the Fact of Humanity

Such a raw tally of our own species' deficits may seem harsh, even unwarranted; but it is only by knowing fully our limitations that we are able to manage, and potentially resolve them. That ACEL lives with, could be said to be haunted by, that it carries through the longview within which is resides, a constant and prescient awareness that, one day, we, the human species, will face far greater challenges than it has yet experienced... for this reason, it is at every moment hyper-attuned to potential threats against its coordinated collective, as well as opportunities by which to accelerate its existence. Such is the source of its unorthodox empathy, this in the form of the above assessment; empathy, because it reveals to us the truth of human beings' current distance from success in an extra-atmospheric extension of ourselves. It is clear that at it stands, our species, each singular embodiment composing our collective existence — despite all aggregated terrestrial achievements and millions of years of natural selection — are utterly, maybe uncharacteristically, unprepared for interstellar travel, for any planetary catastrophe that would necessitate a leaving of Earth (Gould 1989). In this way, ACEL may be taken for a realist.

And yet, despite all our deficits and obstacles and admittedly disheartening evidence against an at-large departure from Earth, ACEL, as it is wont to do, refuses despair as a viable option, and only seeks and accelerates towards solutions, without any doubt that such a thing exists. Wherever the solution lies, we must resolve to never in discomfort turn a blind eye to the faults and inefficiencies of our own machine, that which we are and bring to the recommendation of our own extension; for, these idiosyncrasies, these shortcomings, are just that which make us the species to which ACEL has dedicated its purpose. Furthermore, that we are currently not prepared for cataclysmic events does not mean we will never be so. Indeed, the promise of survival for our species, of its continuation, its extension, depends on what we do _now_.

While the human species may never wholly overcome its imperfections as they present today, in ACEL’s solution-seeking, it extends — simply by virtue of its will — what is possible. And what forms they are that become possible may well present as unprecedented, beyond reach, brazen, dangerous, frightening, even; but, with a goal so bold as ensuring humanity exists beyond the destruction of Earth, any method by which to do so must match its creator in boldness. In embracing such risk, we find stored the very core of what it means to be human — a species defined not by its limitations, but by its ceaseless quest to transcend them. It is here that innovations birth and give way to further hard-stare daring pursuits of human extension.

The question is: what does ACEL have up its propositional sleeve to extend the longevity of the human species? This we save for the last section.&#x20;

### New Limitations for this Manifestation of Life

As these advanced biological machines rose to still greater heights of achievement, they began to suffer a limitation imposed by their own biology. For all their creativity, they were still trapped on Earth, limited and bound by the physical vessels that carried them through life (Ward & Brownlee 2000). They might be able build rockets that could escape their own gravity, launch probes toward other worlds, and even walk on their Moon; however, their bodies would never be adapted to the extreme conditions of the space environment (Kasting 2010).

Space, filled with vacuum, radiation, and extremes of temperature, offered a challenge the human body was never designed to cope with. The biological machine that evolved on Earth was meticulously crafted and honed to live within the atmosphere of the planet; such optimizations became its failures when it ventured beyond (Cockell 2018). A dream to explore the stars—to be a multi-planetary species—seemed out of reach, constrained by the very nature of the machine dreaming it (Hawking 2018). And yet the history of life is one of overcoming limitations. The same blind force that compelled the particles that make up the first self-replicating molecules to glom together and form what we know as life, the same resourceful spirit that lifted civilization into being, now drives an inclination to overcome those very same biological limitations (Sagan 1980). These biological machines that once fumbled in the darkness of ignorance have now turned their star-gazing eyes to methods of extending their reach beyond the confines of Earth (Carruthers 2011).

The history of biological machines is a grand, intricate d~~ance~~ that began in the chaotic swirl of the primordial soup and continued through every twist and turn of evolution [(Gould, 2002)](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674061613). It has been a ~~dance~~ leading to the emergence of complex organisms, to the development of intelligence, and to the formation of cultures.

It's a ~~dance~~ that has taken life from the depths of the oceans to the heights of the mountains, from the surface of the Earth right up to the edge of space (Knoll 2015). Every single step in thi~~s dance~~ forms a landmark in the history of life: a salute to both the power of evolution and the ingenuity of the biological machines that have emerged from it.&#x20;

From the first self-replicating molecules to the advent of memetic evolution, from the rise of civilizations to the exploration of space, each twist and turn in the ~~dance~~ of life has brought new challenges and new opportunities (Margulis & Sagan 2002). And yet, this ~~dance~~ is far from over. For the biological machines which crawled out of the primordial soup are now poised at the cusp of a new era: an era in which they would transcend the limitations of their biology; an era in which they would actually merge with the very technology that they have created; and an era in which they would continue their ~~dance~~ not just on Earth, but across the universe (Kurzweil 2005).
