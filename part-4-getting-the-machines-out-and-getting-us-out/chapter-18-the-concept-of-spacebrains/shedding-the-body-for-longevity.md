# Shedding the Body for Longevity

### Longevity, a Long-Held Virtue

_Longevity_, a household name within our memetic repository, has for millennia been regarded as a virtue of the highest order. Indeed, we see in The Rigveda, the oldest Sanskrit text written between 1500 and 1000 BCE, the desire for and celebration of long life, as Book X Hymn XVIII sings,

> 1. Depart, Death, along the further path, which is your own, different from the one leading to the gods. To you who possess eyes and who listen do I speak: do not harm our offspring nor our heroes.
> 2. ]Effacing the footprint of death when you have gone, establishing for yourselves a longer, more extended lifetime, swelling up with offspring and wealth, become cleansed and purified, o you who are worthy of the sacrifice.
> 3. These the living have turned aside from the dead. The invocation of the gods has become favorable for us today. We have gone facing forward to dancing, to laughter, establishing for ourselves a longer, more extended lifetime.
> 4. I set down this barrier here for the living. Let no one of these later go to this goal. Let them live for a hundred ample autumns. Let them conceal death with a mountain. (Brereton et al. 1400)

Even older, the Pyramid of Unis, which dates between 2375 and 2345 BCE, holds on its wall many passages, one of which translates, “Recitation by Nūt: I enfold your beauty within this soul of mine for all life — permanence, dominion, and health for the King — may he live forever!” (Faulkner 3). Clearly, long life has long been at the forefront of our species’ priorities: It is our positive value signifier of existential success, our barometer of victory over the elements; it is any extension of half-life in the face of, in spite of death.

This at least four millennia-long commendation, the import our species has come to assign _longevity_, has of course been at the root of countless human achievements, particularly in the fields of medicine and technology. To see this, one need only look at the increase in average life expectancy over roughly the last hundred years: from 34 to 72 years. To have more than doubled humanity’s aggregate life expectancy is truly an astounding feat.

### Elongating the Frame of Longevity

This mode of extending life is, as is known by now, core to ACEL thinking. With its primary extending the fact of existence to extend the existence of humanity, a major portion of ACEL’s methodology falls within these . We also know that its gaze is longer, its frame wider than the typical human; as ,

and so it is no surprise that it suggests to push our frame even further — to consider ways to increase human longevity to 200 years or more. This may seem radical,

——we must consider and embrace revolutionary premise: shedding the physical body. What may have long been relegated to the realm of science fiction fantasy is now being put forward as an necessity to major life extension. Isolate the brain from its biological confinements and put it in a controlled environment, and we could improve upon its resilience and how it functions.

Any attempt at life extension is drastically limited by the human biological body, which is vulnerable and subject to decline. The human body will always be a potential victim of disease, physical injuries, and the natural process of aging—against most of which current medicine has insufficient defense. However, assuming an optimal and stable environment, the human brain might be able to function through extended time frames. This idea appears to be a precondition if future options regarding human longevity are considered at all.

Several critical medical breakthroughs would need to take place to realize the SpaceBrains project. Biocompatible materials and safe surgical methods will have to be developed for replacing biological with synthetic supporting mechanisms. First, a method should be developed for surgically removing the brain and lapping it inside a self-contained silicon pod that sustains life. The pod should be able to supply the brain with all its required nutrition, including synthesized glucose, salts, and oxygen, as appropriate, to keep the organ functional. In such a case, the energy needs required by these pods will be provided with reliable and sustainable sources, such as solar panels.

Biocompatibility should not only keep the brain alive, but also ensure an environment where it would thrive. The environment must be properly controlled, emulating its biochemical workings within the body. Variously synthesized nutrients have to be finely balanced and oxygen levels regulated so as not to result in either hypoxia or hyperoxia—either situation leading to substantial damage of the brain. Such a system needs to be very robust and capable of self-healing, making adjustments while ensuring continued survival of the brain.

This vision is more credible when taking into account the recent advances in neural interfacing and biotechnologies. Advanced techniques being developed by companies such as Neuralink have explored the seamless integration of brains into synthetic environments through direct brain-machine interfaces. Bioprinting technologies have proven that it is possible to print synthetic skin and cartilage for medical treatment. Further applying these principles, all of these artificial environments could then be sustained indefinitely, independent of the decaying host organism. Bioprinting foresees the potential synthesis of artificial organs and tissues designed with the intent to cooperate harmoniously with the human brain. Such tissues and organs would be tailor-made to suit one's anatomical physiology, based on one's genotype, to guarantee compatibility and functionality--reducing the risk of transplant rejection.

Further than that, the concept of SpaceBrains has implications way beyond longevity.

By shedding the physical body, we also shed the limitations that our biological systems have imposed upon us. The possibilities for expanded cognitive potential open themselves to us, as now the brain no longer has to manage and maintain a decaying/aging body. Without these constraints, the brain would devote more resources to processing information, learning, and solving problems--leading to considerable rises in intelligence and creativity.

The SpaceBrains project is a potential paradigm shift in how we view human existence and longevity. It challenges conventional notions of life and death, proposing a future wherein consciousness is able to persist indefinitely in a stable, controlled environment. There is nothing in this vision that does not follow the trajectory of scientific and technological developments, meaning that most - not all - of the limitations of our aging processes will eventually be overcome, allowing human potential to skyrocket without being bound by earthly constraints.

Speculative though it may be, longevity by way of body shedding is reaching plausibility. SpaceBrains-a concept made viable by reconciled advances in biocompatible materials, secure surgical techniques, neural interfacing, and bioprinting technologies-holds immense promise for the extension of human lifespans. It is by removing the brain from biological constraints and placing it in an ideal environment that we can amplify its resilience and function, realizing a future of limitless human consciousness. This perspective ushers in a new evolution of humans, where the limitations of the biological body are cast aside and where the total potential of the human mind is realized.

Longevity has served as a torch, leading human aspiration toward medical and technological advances for millennia. However, if we are to achieve real longevity—surviving to 200 years and more—we must embrace a revolutionary premise: shedding the physical body.

Isolate the brain from its biological confinements and put it in a controlled environment, and we could improve upon its resilience and how it functions.
