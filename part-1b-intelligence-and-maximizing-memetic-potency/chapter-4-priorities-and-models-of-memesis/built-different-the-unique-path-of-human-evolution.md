# Built Different: The Unique Path of Human Evolution

Human evolution has always been a story of triumph, struggle, and an insatiable drive toward the unknown. Right from our earliest times, we have journeyed upon a path marked not merely by biological changes but by something deeper than those—our ability to rise beyond the strictures that nature placed upon us (Gamble, 2013). Where other species have been content to adapt to the environment, ours has bent the environment to its will, carved it out to suit its needs, and now stands at the threshold of shaping its evolutionary destiny (Tattersall, 2012).

Once upon a time, a theory captured the imagination of scientists and philosophers alike: orthogenesis—the idea of evolution having a specific direction, purpose, and inevitable endpoint. According to this theory, living organisms developed toward some ultimate goal pulled through some internal "driving force" in the direction of perfection (Bowler, 1989). During the 19th century, consensus on the ground was orthogenesis, mainly because it presented a neat and convincing explanation for why organisms become more complex with time (Ruse, 1996).

But as the process of evolution itself, science is constantly changing. As our level of insight about the natural world sharpened, it became clear that evolution was not so much a straight line marching toward a particular destiny. It is instead a tree-like, anastomosing process, dependent on the conditions of the continuously changing environment (Gould, 1977). In its place, the theory of orthogenesis was discredited, and replaced by the seminal work of Charles Darwin, which showed that evolution proceeds not according to preordained direction but to natural selection—a mechanism acting to accommodate the immediate needs and pressures of the environment (Mayr, 1982).

For Darwin, evolution was a process of adaptation, not progress (Dennett, 1995).

Now, why does this matter? While orthogenesis as a scientific theory may be long buried, its philosophical attractiveness remains—or even brings up new considerations regarding the evolution of _Homo sapien sapiens_ (Bowler, 1989). It thus plays to a deeper human need: to hold onto the view that there is purpose in our evolution—that we are not merely lost adrift in some non-purposive sea of space and time, moving in any particular direction (Leroi, 2014).

Beauty and simplicity are bundled together in the fact that Darwin's theory puts no burden on organisms evolving with a view to the future; instead, their adaptation is driven by present-day challenges. Natural selection and genetic drift have molded this adaptation of life on Earth over billions of years (Futuyma & Kirkpatrick, 2017). Yet, even with all its power, evolution is blind—it has no direction intrinsic to itself, no foresight, no ultimate goal.

The progress we see when we look back at the fossil record of single-celled organisms giving rise to multicellular life, fish evolving onto land animals, and eventually to humans, is merely an illusion (Gould, 1996). More accurately, the process of evolution does not aim for complexity for its own sake. Rather, it simply favors those traits that allow organisms to survive and reproduce in their environments (Gould, 1996).&#x20;

However, we human beings, with our complex cognition and advanced social systems, tend to fall into the trap of thinking of evolution as progress. We think of ourselves somehow as the endpoint of this process, the ultimate product of billions of years of natural selection (Gould, 1996). Yet if evolution has taught us one thing, it is that no species ever represents a final product (Gould, 1996).

The life of every organism, from bacteria to human beings, represents little more than one brief step within the continuing dance of life: a dance with no choreography, no preordained step, and no destination (Dennett, 1995). Yet we rebel against it. There's something in us that wants to believe our evolution is somehow different, that we aren't just another animal, but instead, we are something special, something with a purpose (Richards, 2008). And it's here that the utterly discredited theory of orthogenesis finds new life—not in the world of science, but in philosophy.

Where biological evolution is blind and purposeless, humans have acquired a unique form of evolution: memetic evolution. Whereas genes are passed down by means of reproduction, memes—ideas, knowledge, culture—are relayed using communication and learning (Dawkins, 2006).

Such a prospect puts humans in a privileged position vis-à-vis other species: we are able to evolve not only biologically, but also culturally and intellectually, adapting to new challenges and environments with an unprecedented speed compared to natural selection (Dennett, 1995).

Memetic evolution lets us do something that no other species can: we can design our future. Through knowledge transmission, technological advances, and the development of complex social relations, humans have taken control of their evolutionary fate, for the first time becoming masters of our fate rather than slaves of the environment, passively waiting for the chance mutation to improve our survival chances (Jablonka & Lamb, 2005). Instead, we are self-consciously enhancing ourselves, overcoming our biological constraints, and thereby inventing a future that is quite different from the past. By doing so, we have overcome the blind workings of natural selection (Jablonka & Lamb, 2005).

The French philosopher Henri Bergson expressed in his _Creative Evolution_ that it is not a mechanical but rather a creative life, impelled by an inner élan vital, which in French terms means "vital impulse" (Bergson, 1911). Bergson saw evolution as anything but the working out of a predetermined program aimed at a final result. He saw it as a dynamic creative process, one through which living entities continually adapt and change in response to new challenges (Bergson, 1911). This idea also relates to the ACEL philosophy, whereby human evolution is seen as being created from both biological and metaphysical forces.

But while science can tell us that evolution proceeds without direction or purpose, Bergson gives us a way of framing what a future might conceivably be like in which human consciousness itself becomes the agent in the process (Dennett, 1995). We become no longer passive objects of the process of evolution but dynamic co-creators, creating the next stages of our lives through our choices, acts, and communal volition.

First and foremost, the ACEL movement is not only about understanding the past but mostly about designing the future. We still deny the false science of orthogenesis and advance the greater metaphysical proposition that our species does have the competency and the will to take control of its own evolution. We are not passive objects of genetic mutations and environmental pressures; rather, we are active agents able to affect our future in ways no other creature could (Dennett, 1995). What makes ACEL different from any other philosophy about evolution is that we do not consider ourselves to be products of natural selection, but creators with the capacity to intentionally shape our future.

We are no longer the shackled drivers of blind evolution. We have broken free, and in breaking free, we have opened up the possibility of a new kind of evolution—one driven not by survival but by creativity, intelligence, and purpose (Dennett, 1995).&#x20;

We are built different. Humans are dissimilar from other organisms. We have evolved not just biologically, but memetically (Dawkins, 2006). In our evolution, we took control of our trajectory, shaping a future through knowledge, culture, and technology. We're not just adapting to our environment; we're shaping it, bending it to our will, and creating a future that's uniquely our own (Jablonka & Lamb, 2005). decision

This is the essence of ACEL: We are not passive participants in the unfolding of evolution; we take part as active, creative agents, crafting our future with intention and foresight. We are not just another species driving the chariot of evolution; we are the first species to take the reins towards encoding our DNA with a determination that is supposed to break loose from the fetters of biology and forge our way toward an intentional future (Dennett, 1995).
