# Chapter 4: Fountainhead & Toolshed: Putting Our Endless Meme Supply to Work

### The Mutualism Between _Intelligence_ & _Agency_

This palpable, intensity-dense force — this thrumming potency that stands humans plumb upright and steady-eyed to their catalytic role in the play toward new paradigms — is born not just of a general self-awareness, but of an [awareness _aware_ ](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]of the mechanics of its own intelligence, of its own agency, and of the complementary dynamism shared between these two textures of human consciousness. Ringing true here is Jean-Paul Sartre's quip, "I must necessarily possess a certain comprehension of freedom," where, as is shown below, freedom is but _the_ condition of agency (439). But it is not only the _comprehension_ of the layers composing our consciousness that is within the human's grasp; attendant with this self-appraisal comes the wielding of a directed focus, one able to hone in, even manipulate, even _accelerate_ the acquisition of knowledge and the building of agency.&#x20;

This is an awareness that for now is still unique to human beings; and it is just this that places upon the species' shoulders the opportunity — and the responsibility — to secure the continued survival of biological machines. For, as the premise of ACEL's entire raison d'être — that of securing for humanity a more favorable, i.e. lasting, half-life — is optimally, perhaps _only_ carried out through just this direct engagement with intelligence and agency. For this reason, it is imperative that this book delineate the reasons for and methods by which one might optimize navigating the direct, reflexive, causative relationality between them.&#x20;

In so doing, the human _self_ — specifically, the gears that turn its consciousness towards, and _through_ the extension of its own species – will, of itself, become singularly oriented toward output maximization; both its intelligence and agency most efficiently deployed, all potentials manifest toward extending the survival of the species. How this is accomplished requires further examination into the play between intelligence and agency.&#x20;

#### The Compounding Nature of Their Coordination&#x20;

The formula is simple, as it is directly causative: an increase in intelligence begets an increase in agency; an increase in agency begets an increase in intelligence. Not only do these two textures of consciousness operate harmoniously, they exist in a consistent feedback loop, a reflexively compounding echo chamber of power. This becomes clear when examining the emergent growth of humanity: the RNA replication of itself; the protists' first acts of sexual reproduction; the first standing upright; the first vocalizations grunted — all of these, whether conscious or not, were bold acts of agency that flung wide open the doors to larger intelligence repositories. In turn, these deepened reservoirs of knowledge walked humanity, or a primitive iteration of it, up to yet another explosion of agency. And so on and so forth.&#x20;

Interestingly, when plotting this evolutionary in-step, when tracking their historical foot-stepped data points – variables _quantity over aggregated time_ – the strides of intelligence and agency present a geographical line. That is to say, when zoomed out, there is betrayed out of their concordant play a _fluent, singular directionality_: their power-compounding cadence sometimes ambled, sometimes marched through a 4-billion-year quanta of continuities. Theirs is a long stroll — erratic in the short-term, stabile-in-the-long — defined overall by an aggregated growth of one another, whom together are ever-converging with some later _now_. Thus, it is seen with long aerial view that, over the many once-present millennia, these two pals, from their first step, have only walked in this very direction — to arrive just here with never as so-deep, so-wide, and so-filled oceans of themselves.

#### This Dynamic's Theoretical Precedent&#x20;

Of course, upon this sustained, directional, asymptotic orientation of these two in-cahoots structures of consciousness, particularly their one-by-another brimming-over potential, our curious, perhaps suspicious-for-obviousness, even capitalist-appraising gaze, our locked and literal _self_-enchantment can not claim here what it observes to be original, for this idea is hardly novel: Hegel had been fully aware of this causative interplay between intelligence and agency when writing his 1807 magnum opus, _The Phenomenology of Spirit._ On this, Houlgate sums up cleanly Hegel's position on the matter when he states, "The main source and element of human freedom, for Hegel, is thought" (Houlgate 26). It is easy enough to understand "thought" here as _intelligence_; but what does Hegel mean by _human freedom,_ if not the state of being in total possession of one's own _capacity to act_, _to think_; the being sole proprietor — the _agent_ — of one's own existential property?&#x20;

To corroborate initial readings of Hegel's meaning, we might consider Jean-Paul Sartre's notion of _freedom_ in _On Being and Nothingness: An Essay on Phenomenological Ontology_. Within, Sartre says of _freedom_ — specifically, of the relationship between freedom and "the act_",_ i.e. agency, "the act is the expression of freedom... the fundamental condition of the act is freedom" (Sartre 438). For Sartre, then, _freedom_ is conditional _to_ and expressed _by_ and _through_ action. In short, there is no agency without freedom, because agency _is_ freedom: the _freedom to act_.&#x20;

This evinces a formulaic causative connection between these concepts for Sartre and Hegel: For Sartre, the fundamental condition of action (i.e. agency) is _freedom_; Hegel claims that the source of this freedom is _thought_ (i.e. intelligence). Taken together, Sartre and Hegel reveal that _thought is the source for the condition of action_. Said another way: _intelligence is the source of the condition of agency_.&#x20;

But there is more to this relationship than just unidirectional causality: In fact, when analyzing Hegel (à la Houlgate) through the lens of Sartre's notion of _freedom_, it becomes apparent that Hegel, too, implicitly suggests there exists an intercausative relationship between intelligence and agency. Per Houlgate's quote above, Hegel understood thought/intelligence to be _dual-natured_ in its relationship to freedom/agency: as both the latter's primary "source" _and_ its primary "element". It has already been shown above how thought/intelligence is _source_ _to_ and _causative of_ freedom/agency (i.e. freedom-_by-_thought). It is this second piece — that of thought/intelligence as _elemental_ to freedom/agency — that betrays a simultaneous and inverse causation for Hegel. Using the syllogistic formula, if, for Sartre, "the act is the expression of freedom;" and the main element of freedom for Hegel is _thought_; then it can be stated that, "the act is the expression of the primary element of thought." To say this another way, agency expresses, or manifests, or evokes — _causes —_ intelligence.&#x20;

Thus it is, in the intercausative mutualism between these two structures of consciousness — particularly in the _accelerant_ _leveraging_ of this relationship —that ACEL sees a most optimal ground for its survivalist methodology: that by which it will most effectively ensure the survival and extension of humanity. But, despite their positive relationship, what affords _intelligence_ and _agency_ such allowance of faith, that they together are that which gives humanity its best hope of surviving and extending the existence of humanity?&#x20;

#### Intelligence and Agency in Hegel's _Historical Process_

The answer, perhaps unsurprisingly, can be found in the philosophy of Hegel, particularly in the way in which he views _history_, and the authority of meaning that his _historical process_ endows mankind. Simply put, _history_, for Hegel, is a _human process_ defined by a time-aggregated increase in humanity's self-awareness; Houlgate says, "History is thus the process whereby human beings come to new levels of awareness of their freedom, of their productive, active nature, and thereby produce new forms of social and political life. The human activity of self-production is, therefore, at the same time the process of self-discovery and self-revelation — a fusion of making oneself and finding oneself, of acting and of coming to know, which is perhaps best expressed in English by the word 'self-realization'" (18).&#x20;

While perhaps unconventional to include, in a definition of (what is commonly understood as) _one_ species, _all_ beings that has ever been able to express agency whilst manifesting intelligence; or, multiple kinds of species in an historical account of just one, the inclusive containment of ACEL's _humanity_ is, in a way, little more than a _relational aggregate_ overlaid onto, not all, but just one manageable piece of G.W.F. Hegel's expansive philosophical map; that is, his notion of _history_: University of Warwick professor and Hegelian Dialectic expert, Stephen Houlgate, claims that "History \[for Hegel] is... the process whereby mankind becomes aware of itself as free, self-determining and therefore historical. The absolute truth of humanity is that we are historical, and the history of humanity is the process of coming to recognize our absolute, historical character. History and truth are thus completely inseparable for Hegel, and it is not possible to drop or reject either term" (Houlgate 17). The historical process carried out by humans, then, the one in which humanity becomes evermore aware of itself, is directionally driven by the "goal... to become conscious of&#x20;themselves as freely and historically self-productive and self-determining" (Houlgate 21).&#x20;

Houlgate's framing could not have been much more attuned to the present purposes. While it is of note how he lays out Hegel's history as a process defined by a time-aggregated growth of humanity's self-awareness — one that progresses towards a "self-realization", of most interest are the modes by which Hegel's _historical process_ advances. Of these, there are two. The first is "the human activity of self-production", which is none other than the activation of _agency_; the other is "the process of self-discovery and self-revelation", or, the growth of _intelligence_ (18). But that is not all: Houlgate notes that this _activation of agency_ "is, therefore, at the same time" the _growth of intelligence_. They are of one substance; and he states this is, "a fusion... of _acting_ and of _coming to_ _know_" (italics added for emphasis) (18). Thus, for Hegel, humanity evolves itself towards self-realization through the ceaseless compounding play between its intelligence and its agency. As self-realization connotes a _surviving_ to that end, so it is for ACEL.&#x20;

Still more can be gleaned from how, and _where_, intelligence and agency manifest within Hegel's historical framework. Houlgate notes that "the profound changes \[of humanity] that interest Hegel have been produced... by our becoming more conscious of our freedom and potential for self-determination, and more aware of the way in which that freedom is to be realized and fulfilled in the world" (8). Elsewhere, Houlgate says that "Hegel argues the most important changes in history have involved shifts in the categories through&#x20;which human beings understand their world... They have been shifts brought about by humanity's growing&#x20;self-awareness... " (12). Still later he states, "The fundamental&#x20;advances in history... are thus the result, for Hegel, of mankind's becoming more aware of itself&#x20;as freely self-determining and thereby actually coming to be more freely self-determining&#x20;in history" (14). In other words, attendant to all of the "profound changes", "the most important changes in history", and "fundamental advancements" that humanity has experienced over time, both our species' gravest historical intensities as well as its most miraculous advancements, are these two faculties of human consciousness — are _intelligence_ and _agency_. At any major point in the history of humanity, these two pals are front and center.&#x20;

#### Placing ACEL's _Humanity_ within Hegel's _Historical Process_&#x20;

Here we must account for one substantive, but not deal-breaking, difference between Hegel's model and that of ACEL, which can be explained with the help of the following quote: In discussing the evolution of humanity, Houlgate notes that _"_\[Hegel] does believe that within the manifold vicissitudes of human history there is an identifiable strand of development from humanity's initial, primitive self-understanding to the much more enlightened perspective of the modern age" (12). As we know, each hole by which this "strand" threads itself into the historical process are, for Hegel, those ones marked by long-tail explosions of self-reflective and dual-compounding human intelligence and agency. However, this entire historical process is restricted to Hegel's use of the term, _humanity_, to denote only the _homo sapien sapien_. While ACEL undoubtedly agrees that there is an "identifiable strand of development from humanity's initial, primitive self-understanding...", it diverges from Hegel only insofar in that its understanding of the _humanity_ comprises all things that manifest intelligence and agency; and thus include that wider range going all the way back to pre-life RNA. This is more or less the sole difference in models.&#x20;

Indeed, the framework even comes attendant with, as ACEL's does, a sense of immediate necessity: though Hegel lived three centuries ago, once this process revealed itself to him, he understood that "It is in the modern period, therefore, when human consciousness at last recognizes that it&#x20;is the essential nature of all of humanity to be free, that the demand that thought should&#x20;make itself as explicitly autonomous and self-grounding as it can becomes most urgent" (Houlgate 28).&#x20;

Just as Hegel's urgency permeates throughout the entirety of ACEL — that it must succeed, and it must accelerate that success _now_ — so, too, does it adopt its "goal of historical activity, \[which] for Hegel, is... for human beings to become conscious of themselves as freely and historically self-productive and self-determining... and for them to build their world in accordance with that recognition." In doing so, "we learn that it is above all through changes in our self-understanding that we actually make ourselves into and so _become_ something new: we produce ourselves precisely through developing a fuller understanding that we do so" (21).&#x20;

ACEL's _process of humanity_ is also historically embedded, and directionally driven towards an ever-increasing self-awareness, one built upon maximized intelligence and agency. The key difference here is that Hegel's "historical character" assumes in its definition _homo sapiens_ only, whereas ACEL adopts a relational view of his historical character. That is to say, for ACEL, _humanity_ does not become _historical_ until it accounts for, and includes within it, all relational affectations by which it processually became and becomes itself.

For all the reasons above, and more, it within this frame, then, ACEL might hazard to overlay its own historical framework onto this one manageable piece of Hegel's extensive philosophical map — namely, by _enlarging_ Hegel's historical process to contain ACEL's wider, elongated notion of _humanity_. By doing so, the latter thought system might well adopt from Hegel's historical process a comparative model that implants ACEL's _humanity_ into Hegel's _history_, thereby following _"_this process of growing self-awareness \[to its] endpoint: namely when we become fully conscious of the fact that all human beings have the potential to be free, self-determining agents" (Houlgate 8).&#x20;

While ACEL's _humanity_ – its directionality, its purpose, its units of measurement, its final destination, its orientation to human evolution (ACEL might even allow human _spiritual_ evolution) – all of these, while ever so cautiously, may be said to tiptoe alongside Hegel's definition of "history". The only major divergence, for which ACEL would remain incomplete were it not present, is the inclusion of "the Human's" _affective_, _relational_ ancestry leading up to the modern human and its society. It should be said here that ACEL of course makes no accusation to Hegel's understanding of _history_ as less than complete in an of itself; ACEL only intends to incorporate an _affective_ understanding of the historical character to its framework. The reasoning behind this choice is ACEL's prioritization of increasing current humans' knowledge repositories: by including _all_ agency-shifting affective relations, those that in some way led humanity to its present unfolding, every step of the species' evolution is able to be review, analyzed, reworked.

That Hegel lays out a vision of history that advances due to the perpetually compounding relationship between intelligence and agency, which for ACEL has perpetuated and compounded upon one another since life, even pre-life, began — his seems a most useful framework to adopt. More, the urgency is present; the goal is the same; the methods of evolution are synonymous. Clearly, one need not reinvent the wheel; and ACEL might, albeit delicately, employ Hegel's historical process to its own ends.&#x20;

In so doing, humanity, still humbly walking alongside Hegel, may being turn its gaze from that which already took place to that which has not yet. When looking at the yet-to-come, humanity, per ACEL, again expands its meaning: A day — likely soon — will arrive on humanity's definable doorstep and demand that this conglomerate of agencies and intelligence include yet another kind of being altogether: a non-biological being. A Silicon Machine. While modern-day humans are currently the apex of potential, as we continue in our creation of Silicon Machines that will, when finally endowed with a forcing function, expand intelligence and maximize agency far more efficiently than we, they will be the ones to carry our flame of consciousness deeper into the universe.&#x20;

### 'Berger & Dennett: How Memes Persist&#x20;

Recall from Chapter 1 that Berger frames the half-life of all social constructions — i.e. memes — within his theoretical notion of _legitimation_. This is more or less a time-based process of _reminding_ members of their memetic foundations; he states, "If the nomos \[i.e. the body of governing customs] of a society is to be transmitted from one generation to another, so that the new generation will also come to 'inhabit' the same social world, there will have to be legitimating formulas to answer the questions that, inevitably, will arise in the minds of the new generation'" (Berger 40-41). He nods to the fact that the process of legitimation is synonymous with the meme's ability to defend its social existence, which he frames as being "... grounded in problems of socialization and social control;" for, "Any exercise of social control... demands legitimation over and above the self-legitimating facticity of the institutional arrangements — precisely because this facticity is put in question by the resisters who are to be controlled" (Berger 40, 41). While Berger's framing sounds aggressive here as it harps on this notion of "control", he is in fact saying nothing more extreme than Dennett's positing of "... the possibility that cultural entities may evolve according to selectional regimes that make sense only when the answer to the _Cui bono_ question is that it is the cultural items themselves that benefit from the adaptations they exhibit" (Dennett 4). To state this more simply, both thinkers are relating the same method by which a meme fundamentally extends its existence through time. We can therefore take Dennett's "cultural items" _as_ Berger's "exercise\[s] in social control" — both are simply being cleverly referential to memetic structures (e.g. memes); but the most compelling piece of this cognitive harmony of how these two see memes persisting through time, is that they _both attribute the agency-to-control_ _to_ _the_ _cultural items — to the memes —_ _themselves_.&#x20;

Already, we are hardly only talking about Religion anymore. Granted, should we take Dennett's wit as law in his section title, _Memes as Cultural Viruses_ (Dennett 4), which immediately follows the above quotation, then we can simply close this book and conclude that ACEL and the pessimist theorizers are _both_ wrong: If every memetic structure is oppressive and parasitic in its agency, then ACEL was far too optimistic and our Marx and our Weber weren't pessimistic enough. Common sense may stop in here for a moment: Dennett's analogy to memes as viruses, and indeed Berger's insistence upon "control" is primarily indebted towards the _movement_ factor and the _contagion_ factor of viruses, _not_ its qualifiable life-debilitating, agency-draining nature. If this were in fact the case, then the meme of waving your hand in saying hello to a friend across the street would leave us utterly incapacitated, as if a parasite were attacking us simply by the action. For these reasons, Berger's notion of _legitimation_ can therefore be understood as a _neutral-in-tone_ socially-organizing set of influential reminders; religion being but one of many organizational constructions.&#x20;









### Built Different: The Unique Path of Human Evolution

Human evolution has always been a story of triumph, struggle, and an insatiable drive toward the unknown. Right from our earliest times, we have journeyed upon a path marked not merely by biological changes but by something deeper than those—our ability to rise beyond the strictures that nature placed upon us (Gamble, 2013). Where other species have been content to adapt to the environment, ours has bent the environment to its will, carved it out to suit its needs, and now stands at the threshold of shaping its evolutionary destiny (Tattersall, 2012).

Once upon a time, a theory captured the imagination of scientists and philosophers alike: orthogenesis—the idea of evolution having a specific direction, purpose, and inevitable endpoint. According to this theory, living organisms developed toward some ultimate goal pulled through some internal "driving force" in the direction of perfection (Bowler, 1989). During the 19th century, consensus on the ground was orthogenesis, mainly because it presented a neat and convincing explanation for why organisms become more complex with time (Ruse, 1996).

But as the process of evolution itself, science is constantly changing. As our level of insight about the natural world sharpened, it became clear that evolution was not so much a straight line marching toward a particular destiny. It is instead a rhizomatic, anastomosing process, dependent on the conditions of the continuously changing environment (Gould, 1977). Thus, the theory of orthogenesis was discredited, and replaced by the seminal work of Charles Darwin, which showed that evolution proceeds not according to preordained direction but to natural selection—a mechanism acting to accommodate the immediate needs and pressures of the environment (Mayr, 1982).&#x20;

For Darwin, evolution was a process of adaptation, not progress (Dennett, 1995). Deleuze and Guattari say of transformation of multiplicities:&#x20;

> _each multiplicity is continually transforming itself into a string of other multiplicities, according to its thresholds and doors_... Each multiplicity is defined by a borderline... there is a string of borderlines, a continuous line of borderlines (_fiber_) following which the multiplicity changes.. A fiber stretches from a human to an animal, from a human to an animal to molecules, from molecules to particles, and so on to the imperceptible. Every fiber is a Universe fiber. A fiber strung across borderlines constitutes a line of flight or deterritorialization... The error we must guard against is to believe that there is a kind of logical order to this string, these crossings or transformations. It is already going too far to postulate an order descending from the animal to the vegetable, then to molecules, to particles. Each multiplicity is symbiotic; its becoming ties together animals, plants, microorganisms, mad particles, a whole galaxy... Not following a logical order, but following alogical consistencies or compatibilities. The reason is simple. It is because no one, not even God, can say in advance whether two borderlines will string together or form a fiber, whether a given multiplicity will or will not cross over into another given multiplicity, or even if given heterogeneous elements will enter symbiosis, will form a consistent, or cofunctioning, multiplicity susceptible to transformation (Deleuze and Guattari, _Plateaus_ 249, 250).&#x20;



> Darwin had also to acknowledge that according to his theory of variation under natural selection, by which he claimed to account for the modifification of organisms along lines of descent, each organism on a line exists solely to be itself, to fulfifil a project coterminous with the bounds of its own existence. It neither carries forward the life-course of its antecedents nor anticipates that of its descendants, for what it passes on to the future, by way if its own reproduction, is not its life but a suite of hereditary character istics that may be recombined or reassembled in the formation of other projects for other lives. In this Darwinian conception, evolution is absolutely not a life-process. Whereas evolution takes place across generations, life is expended within each generation... (Ingold, _Lines_ 113-14)&#x20;

Now, why does this matter? While orthogenesis as a scientific theory may be long buried, its philosophical attractiveness remains—or even brings up new considerations regarding the evolution of _Homo sapien sapiens_ (Bowler, 1989). It thus plays to a deeper human need: to hold onto the view that there is purpose in our evolution—that we are not merely lost adrift in some non-purposive sea of space and time, moving in any particular direction (Leroi, 2014).

Beauty and simplicity are bundled together in the fact that Darwin's theory puts no burden on organisms evolving with a view to the future; instead, their adaptation is driven by present-day challenges. Natural selection and genetic drift have molded this adaptation of life on Earth over billions of years (Futuyma & Kirkpatrick, 2017). Yet, even with all its power, evolution is blind—it has no direction intrinsic to itself, no foresight, no ultimate goal.

The progress we see when we look back at the fossil record of single-celled organisms giving rise to multicellular life, fish evolving onto land animals, and eventually to humans, is merely an illusion (Gould, 1996). More accurately, the process of evolution does not aim for complexity for its own sake. Rather, it simply favors those traits that allow organisms to survive and reproduce in their environments (Gould, 1996).&#x20;

However, we human beings, with our complex cognition and advanced social systems, tend to fall into the trap of thinking of evolution as progress. We think of ourselves somehow as the endpoint of this process, the ultimate product of billions of years of natural selection (Gould, 1996). Yet if evolution has taught us one thing, it is that no species ever represents a final product (Gould, 1996).

The life of every organism, from bacteria to human beings, represents little more than one brief step within the continuing dance of life: a dance with no choreography, no preordained step, and no destination (Dennett, 1995). Yet we rebel against it. There's something in us that wants to believe our evolution is somehow different, that we aren't just another animal, but instead, we are something special, something with a purpose (Richards, 2008). And it's here that the utterly discredited theory of orthogenesis finds new life—not in the world of science, but in philosophy.

Where biological evolution is blind and purposeless, humans have acquired a unique form of evolution: memetic evolution. Whereas genes are passed down by means of reproduction, memes—ideas, knowledge, culture—are relayed using communication and learning (Dawkins, 2006).

Such a prospect puts humans in a privileged position vis-à-vis other species: we are able to evolve not only biologically, but also culturally and intellectually, adapting to new challenges and environments with an unprecedented speed compared to natural selection (Dennett, 1995).

Memetic evolution lets us do something that no other species can: we can design our future. Through knowledge transmission, technological advances, and the development of complex social relations, humans have taken control of their evolutionary fate, for the first time becoming masters of our fate rather than slaves of the environment, passively waiting for the chance mutation to improve our survival chances (Jablonka & Lamb, 2005). Instead, we are self-consciously enhancing ourselves, overcoming our biological constraints, and thereby inventing a future that is quite different from the past. By doing so, we have overcome the blind workings of natural selection (Jablonka & Lamb, 2005).

The French philosopher Henri Bergson expressed in his _Creative Evolution_ that it is not a mechanical but rather a creative life, impelled by an inner élan vital, which in French terms means "vital impulse" (Bergson, 1911). Bergson saw evolution as anything but the working out of a predetermined program aimed at a final result. He saw it as a dynamic creative process, one through which living entities continually adapt and change in response to new challenges (Bergson, 1911). This idea also relates to the ACEL philosophy, whereby human evolution is seen as being created from both biological and metaphysical forces.

But while science can tell us that evolution proceeds without direction or purpose, Bergson gives us a way of framing what a future might conceivably be like in which human consciousness itself becomes the agent in the process (Dennett, 1995). We become no longer passive objects of the process of evolution but dynamic co-creators, creating the next stages of our lives through our choices, acts, and communal volition.

First and foremost, the ACEL movement is not only about understanding the past but mostly about designing the future. We still deny the false science of orthogenesis and advance the greater metaphysical proposition that our species does have the competency and the will to take control of its own evolution. We are not passive objects of genetic mutations and environmental pressures; rather, we are active agents able to affect our future in ways no other creature could (Dennett, 1995). What makes ACEL different from any other philosophy about evolution is that we do not consider ourselves to be products of natural selection, but creators with the capacity to intentionally shape our future.

We are no longer the shackled drivers of blind evolution. We have broken free, and in breaking free, we have opened up the possibility of a new kind of evolution—one driven not by survival but by creativity, intelligence, and purpose (Dennett, 1995).&#x20;

We are built different. Humans are dissimilar from other organisms. We have evolved not just biologically, but memetically (Dawkins, 2006). In our evolution, we took control of our trajectory, shaping a future through knowledge, culture, and technology. We're not just adapting to our environment; we're shaping it, bending it to our will, and creating a future that's uniquely our own (Jablonka & Lamb, 2005). decision

This is the essence of ACEL: We are not passive participants in the unfolding of evolution; we take part as active, creative agents, crafting our future with intention and foresight. We are not just another species driving the chariot of evolution; we are the first species to take the reins towards encoding our DNA with a determination that is supposed to break loose from the fetters of biology and forge our way toward an intentional future (Dennett, 1995).

[^1]: did this on purpose - not a typo. considering "beingness" in place of awareness
