## Theoretical Possibilities for the Remarkable, Mutable Human Body

To return here to Kuriyama's work on the historical evolution of the _Eastern body_ and the _Western body,_ there seems to emerge out of his findings a potentia this duality — each unknown to the other yet simultaneously created to answer the same question, e.g. "How does the the human body exist in the world?" — creates for us the poles of a stable and consistent spectrum upon which other models of embodiment might hang; given, of course, that they attend to the same question. For instance, for the ancient Chinese, their perception of the body was relationally indistinguishable from the environment of Earth; theirs was a true _lived ambivalence_ to definitions, to lines — it was a holistic philosophy embodied. At the very same time, on the other side of the globe, an admiration of muscularity and sinewy bodies evolved into the concept of agency and the lauding of _might_ and _power_. From this was born _the_ _individual_. Both marvelous in their own right, these two renderings of the body, created entirely unawares of the other, yet at the same time, are almost _exact opposites_ in theoretical description. And yet, they both exist just as well. In their addressing one point, they established a continuity within which new theoretical human bodies might exist. That the human body indeed seems ever capable of accepting and holding new frames placed upon it by us, it truly does seem to be a remarkable manifestation, one truly built to evolve with its theorizers.

With correlatives and causatives enough to fill libraries (and they do), it is the Western gaze that the human body has come to adorn with a dominance for the modern world and its value system. In this way, _agency_ — often understood in like terms such as a_chievement_ and _advancement_ — came to situate itself as the dominant code of culture, aggregated. It goes without saying that our longview embodied collective did not fail to produce results in the name of _agency_: Through a _survival continuity_ as our standard, and a willful perseverance to achieve such heights (at times in the face of threats grave and contra-existence), our species yet lives, thus proving it still indefatigable and unbeaten in its wide-frame cohesion, in its singular and certain directionality. In this way, we have surpassed every benchmark placed in our path.

Or nearly every benchmark. For, we, each of us, live, either consciously or not, out a subtle terror of a being trapped during a cataclysmic _yet-to-come_, an event we know full well these so-called "powerful" bodies of ours — these marvels that have over millennia evolved to asymptotic harmony with Earth's gravity, yet no more than that — would be unequivocally decimated, annihilated, were that prospect to arrive tomorrow. We refer here, of course, to a planetary singularity. Suffice to say, our species, attuned as it is to Earth, has proven itself so much the opposite in its ability to withstand virtually any environment beyond Earth's atmosphere. In other words, we, us powerful agents, are severely unfit for anywhere but where we are; we are, in short, incapable of leaving this planet at scale.&#x20;

This presents a very grave problem, for it is just that impending doom beyond our cosmic horizon that throws humanity its most dangerous challenge _in potentia_ — a challenge it has yet to even come close to solving, yet a challenge that will, with certainty, arrive, whether we are still here to greet it or not.&#x20;

### The End of Earth’s Habitability

It is common knowledge that, one day, Earth will cease to be habitable by all living organisms. While most might shrug this off as a problem for a set of far distant future humans, ACEL, very much today, claims another path, a path of responsibility and resolve. It chooses to shoulder the burden of this impending reality as a prescient issue, one which humanity _must_ solve, and sooner than later; before ACEL evolves beyond its own self, it will make concerted efforts towards the discovery of a solution for its collective species. Recall here that the fundamental purpose of ACEL remains ever-singular: to extend the existence of humanity. Here the full scope of its literal sincerity might finally be understood: for ACEL, humanity does not end with the end of Earth. What this means, of course, is that ACEL does and has always, intended to help perpetuate human life beyond the bounds of this planet.

As it stands, however, even with the most advanced technology available, human bodies remain incapable of withstanding long durations beyond Earth’s atmosphere; their impeccable-for-Earth evolutionary design have made our bodies perfect for one place only — this truth is with respect to not only human biology, but also human psychology, human sociality. In other words, the holistic human being is not yet ready for what is next.&#x20;

### Biological Limitations

We know through a plethora of empirical studies that the physical human body, once it transcends Earth’s atmosphere, does not maintain its structural integrity well. In the weightlessness of space, human muscles — ordinarily acclimated to counter Earth’s gravitational forces — rapidly and substantially atrophy due to the lack of gravity against which to effort (Hawkey 2003). Hypokinesis and sleep disruption will likely occur as well (Basner et al. 2012). These are standard physical responses for a body accustomed to gravity: in the vacuousness of space, the human body — attuned perfectly, in a literal sense, to Earth’s gravity and its attendant air pressure — loses the opposing forces that otherwise maintain its structural integrity. While strong on Earth, the body in space, without opposition, grows weak, helpless.

Furthermore, in such journeys, the human body abandons both of Earth’s natural cosmic radiation shields: its magnetic field, as well as its atmosphere. While recent improvements to artificial shields — on spacecraft, for instance — marginally help to mitigate the effects of radiation on astronauts’ bodies, they are by far from total in their protection. Even with these protective layers, high-energy particles still gain deep entry into tissues, increasing the risk of cancers and other degenerative diseases, like cataracts (Cucinotta et al. 2001). Additionally, due to this microgravity, bone density loss, e.g. osteoporosis, will also likely occur as a result (Vico et al. 2000).&#x20;

Taken together, our bodies are more or less destroyed in space.&#x20;

### Psychological Limitations 1

Unfortunately, the human body’s interstellar disadvantages do not end at the physical level: there is also the psychological component that further delays any optimism for safe departure from Earth. As humans are, by nature, social beings hardwired for interaction, for belonging, for sociality, the requisite environment of space travel, marked as it is without exception by isolation and confinement, poses severe challenges to even the most solitary astronauts. In other words, the social conditions of a long-duration spaceflight present in direct contrast to a healthy human habitat, lacking as they do the necessary psychological outlets. Depression, anxiety, and cognitive decline are but some of the psychological receipts paid for both during and after a period of prolonged solitude in space (Sandal et al. 2011). A telling anecdote of space travel’s psychological fallouts would be some results pulled from Peter Suedfeld's report on simulated Mars missions to Mars.  He states, "There have been dramatic incidents: a reported murder over a chess game in a Russian station, an Argentine physician setting fire to his own station, violent fights in a variety of stations... "winter-over syndrome" comprises cognitive impairment, sleep disturbances (especially insomnia, the so-called "Big Eye"), interpersonal conflict, negative affect, depression, anxiety, and low energy. Fugue states (the "twenty-foot stare in the ten-foot room," or "Long Eye") also occur" (Suedfeld 2010). Are we ready? These results speak for themselves.&#x20;

### Psychological Limitations 2

There is even yet another criteria by which our psychological makeup might betray us on a spaceflight mission. Just as we are _needy_ beings given or social nature, we are just as much habitual poor decision makers, and not just from lack of intelligence. Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman has opened our cultural eyes with his research on our species' unconscious tendency to hold cognitive biases when making judgements and choices. According to Kahneman, we humans all-too-often deploy untenable or inaccurate rationales in making our judgments and choices (to be sure, we do not need outer space to prove this is so). In other words, when forming a judgment, or making a choice, we unconsciously gravitate towards a range of misguided and fallacious frameworks to do so; this is due to a number of reasons. All of us each carry any number of unconscious cognitive biases — overconfidence, associative memory, and framing-in-isolation, to name a few — that inaccurately inform what would otherwise be sound conclusive resolutions (Kahneman 2011). Regarding our already fragile existences in space, it is no far stone to throw to see just how much danger, even lethality, a mental misstep of this nature would add to the already high stakes of space travel. To illustrate this point, we might consider the Apollo 13 mission — whose passage home was _still_ not guaranteed after impeccable decision-making in impossibly high pressure scenarios — and if the world would still be able to celebrate the same outcome were one of the team members to make even one overly confident choice, or the opposite: to freeze up when a decision needed making (Leach 2004). Suffice to say, the already mad improbability of that miraculous and skilled team's safe return would be far lower were any cognitive bias at play (Lovell & Kluger, 2006).

## Facing the Facts to Extend the Fact of Humanity

Such a raw tally of our own species' deficits may seem harsh, even unwarranted; but it is only by knowing fully our limitations that we are able to manage, and potentially resolve them. That ACEL lives with, could be said to be haunted by, that it carries through the longview within which is resides, a constant and prescient awareness that, one day, we, the human species, will face far greater challenges than it has yet experienced... for this reason, it is at every moment hyper-attuned to potential threats against its coordinated collective, as well as opportunities by which to accelerate its existence. Such is the source of its unorthodox empathy, this in the form of the above assessment; empathy, because it reveals to us the truth of human beings' current distance from success in an extra-atmospheric extension of ourselves. It is clear that at it stands, our species, each singular embodiment composing our collective existence — despite all aggregated terrestrial achievements and millions of years of natural selection — are utterly, maybe uncharacteristically, unprepared for interstellar travel, for any planetary catastrophe that would necessitate a leaving of Earth (Gould 1989). In this way, ACEL may be taken for a realist.

And yet, despite all our deficits and obstacles and admittedly disheartening evidence against an at-large departure from Earth, ACEL, as it is wont to do, refuses despair as a viable option, and only seeks and accelerates towards solutions, without any doubt that such a thing exists. Wherever the solution lies, we must resolve to never in discomfort turn a blind eye to the faults and inefficiencies of our own machine, that which we are and bring to the recommendation of our own extension; for, these idiosyncrasies, these shortcomings, are just that which make us the species to which ACEL has dedicated its purpose. Furthermore, that we are currently not prepared for cataclysmic events does not mean we will never be so. Indeed, the promise of survival for our species, of its continuation, its extension, depends on what we do _now_.

While the human species may never wholly overcome its imperfections as they present today, in ACEL’s solution-seeking, it extends — simply by virtue of its will — what is possible. And what forms they are that become possible may well present as unprecedented, beyond reach, brazen, dangerous, frightening, even; but, with a goal so bold as ensuring humanity exists beyond the destruction of Earth, any method by which to do so must match its creator in boldness. In embracing such risk, we find stored the very core of what it means to be human — a species defined not by its limitations, but by its ceaseless quest to transcend them. It is here that innovations birth and give way to further hard-stare daring pursuits of human extension.

The question is: what does ACEL have up its propositional sleeve to extend the longevity of the human species?

### Longevity, a Long-Held Virtue

_Longevity_, a household name within our memetic repository, has for millennia been regarded as a virtue of the highest order. Indeed, we see in The Rigveda, the oldest Sanskrit text written between 1500 and 1000 BCE, the desire for and celebration of long life, as Book X Hymn XVIII sings,

> 1. Depart, Death, along the further path, which is your own, different from the one leading to the gods. To you who possess eyes and who listen do I speak: do not harm our offspring nor our heroes.
> 2. &#x20;Effacing the footprint of death when you have gone, establishing for yourselves a longer, more extended lifetime, swelling up with offspring and wealth, become cleansed and purified, o you who are worthy of the sacrifice.
> 3. These the living have turned aside from the dead. The invocation of the gods has become favorable for us today. We have gone facing forward to dancing, to laughter, establishing for ourselves a longer, more extended lifetime.
> 4. I set down this barrier here for the living. Let no one of these later go to this goal. Let them live for a hundred ample autumns. Let them conceal death with a mountain. (Brereton et al. 1400)

Even older, the Pyramid of Unis, which dates between 2375 and 2345 BCE, holds on its wall many passages, one of which translates, “Recitation by Nūt: I enfold your beauty within this soul of mine for all life — permanence, dominion, and health for the King — may he live forever!” (Faulkner 3). Clearly, long life has long been at the forefront of our species’ priorities: It is our positive value signifier of existential success, our barometer of victory over the elements; it is any extension of half-life in the face of, in spite of death.

This at least four millennia-long commendation, the import our species has come to assign _longevity_, has of course been at the root of countless human achievements, particularly in the fields of medicine and technology. To see this, one need only look at the increase in average life expectancy over roughly the last hundred years: from 34 to 72 years. To have more than doubled humanity’s aggregate life expectancy is truly an astounding feat.

### Elongating the Frame of Longevity

This mode of extending life is, as is known by now, core to ACEL thinking. With its primary extending the fact of existence to extend the existence of humanity, a major portion of ACEL’s methodology falls within these . We also know that its gaze is longer, its frame wider than the typical human; as ,

and so it is no surprise that it suggests to push our frame even further — to consider ways to increase human longevity to 200 years or more. This may seem radical,

——we must consider and embrace revolutionary premise: shedding the physical body. What may have long been relegated to the realm of science fiction fantasy is now being put forward as an necessity to major life extension. Isolate the brain from its biological confinements and put it in a controlled environment, and we could improve upon its resilience and how it functions.

***

Any attempt at life extension is drastically limited by the human biological body, which is vulnerable and subject to decline. The human body will always be a potential victim of disease, physical injuries, and the natural process of aging—against most of which current medicine has insufficient defense. However, assuming an optimal and stable environment, the human brain might be able to function through extended time frames. This idea appears to be a precondition if future options regarding human longevity are considered at all.

Several critical medical breakthroughs would need to take place to realize the SpaceBrains project. Biocompatible materials and safe surgical methods will have to be developed for replacing biological with synthetic supporting mechanisms. First, a method should be developed for surgically removing the brain and lapping it inside a self-contained silicon pod that sustains life. The pod should be able to supply the brain with all its required nutrition, including synthesized glucose, salts, and oxygen, as appropriate, to keep the organ functional. In such a case, the energy needs required by these pods will be provided with reliable and sustainable sources, such as solar panels.

Biocompatibility should not only keep the brain alive, but also ensure an environment where it would thrive. The environment must be properly controlled, emulating its biochemical workings within the body. Variously synthesized nutrients have to be finely balanced and oxygen levels regulated so as not to result in either hypoxia or hyperoxia—either situation leading to substantial damage of the brain. Such a system needs to be very robust and capable of self-healing, making adjustments while ensuring continued survival of the brain.

This vision is more credible when taking into account the recent advances in neural interfacing and biotechnologies. Advanced techniques being developed by companies such as Neuralink have explored the seamless integration of brains into synthetic environments through direct brain-machine interfaces. Bioprinting technologies have proven that it is possible to print synthetic skin and cartilage for medical treatment. Further applying these principles, all of these artificial environments could then be sustained indefinitely, independent of the decaying host organism. Bioprinting foresees the potential synthesis of artificial organs and tissues designed with the intent to cooperate harmoniously with the human brain. Such tissues and organs would be tailor-made to suit one's anatomical physiology, based on one's genotype, to guarantee compatibility and functionality--reducing the risk of transplant rejection.

Further than that, the concept of SpaceBrains has implications way beyond longevity.

By shedding the physical body, we also shed the limitations that our biological systems have imposed upon us. The possibilities for expanded cognitive potential open themselves to us, as now the brain no longer has to manage and maintain a decaying/aging body. Without these constraints, the brain would devote more resources to processing information, learning, and solving problems--leading to considerable rises in intelligence and creativity.

The SpaceBrains project is a potential paradigm shift in how we view human existence and longevity. It challenges conventional notions of life and death, proposing a future wherein consciousness is able to persist indefinitely in a stable, controlled environment. There is nothing in this vision that does not follow the trajectory of scientific and technological developments, meaning that most - not all - of the limitations of our aging processes will eventually be overcome, allowing human potential to skyrocket without being bound by earthly constraints.

Speculative though it may be, longevity by way of body shedding is reaching plausibility. SpaceBrains-a concept made viable by reconciled advances in biocompatible materials, secure surgical techniques, neural interfacing, and bioprinting technologies-holds immense promise for the extension of human lifespans. It is by removing the brain from biological constraints and placing it in an ideal environment that we can amplify its resilience and function, realizing a future of limitless human consciousness. This perspective ushers in a new evolution of humans, where the limitations of the biological body are cast aside and where the total potential of the human mind is realized.\
