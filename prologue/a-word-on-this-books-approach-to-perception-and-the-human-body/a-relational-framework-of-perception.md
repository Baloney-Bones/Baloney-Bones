# Aligning 'Humanity' On Relational Lines

This book, much as it takes _humanity_—particularly its evolutionary life on and beyond Earth—as its foremost philosophical concern, requires that a clarifying attendance be taken at the outset to sufficiently define the parameters by which it understands the concept. That is to say, we must situate, within a viable, sustained theoretical framework, _the human_, both individually and collectively, not only as a _something_ that exists in the world, but _how_ that _something_ '_somethings_' in relation it. Should this step be foregone, the reader should have no grounding or confidence that their interpretation of the words to follow are, in fact, the delivery intended. Such is the purpose of this prologue.&#x20;

First, we will introduce, as our framework of choice, a preexisting theoretical concept already well established in the human and social sciences. Then, we will outline a particular _lived_ historical precedent, one that embodied this understanding of humanity; by this, we may more aptly situate the concept within this book's thought system, which we call 'ACEL'. Finally, steps will be taken to orient the reader with certain considerations attendant to the book's theoretical _buy-in_.&#x20;

As ACEL values both empirical and philosophical approaches to understanding human life, we break ground in this process with a brief survey of the historical landscape of human perception studies, and then move into the broader concerns proferred by phenomenology. &#x20;

## Challenges in Studying '_the human_'

### The Elusive Nature of Human Perception

As an area of technical study, human sensory perception stands as one of the most discipline-ranging and historically attended-to research subjects in academic, clinical, and commercial fields. And yet, even with its scientific origins dating back to Aristotle's _De Anima_ (350BCE), the full scope and mystery of human sensory perception has continued to elude our species' grasp. Even with countless reworkings and reimaginings—whether theoretical, empirical, or technological—we are still only so much closer to a comprehensive, true, and definitive model by which our culture actionably understands our sensory faculties and their relation to affective stimuli. &#x20;

Despite this failure to-date, our collective curiosity remains at full mast. This can be seen by the fact that the Nobel Prize was just awarded in 2021 to two sensory perception researchers. While this accolade was given for breakthroughs in the biological sciences, perhaps the most incisive contributions have come from within the human and social sciences, particularly that of anthropology, sociology, and philosophy.&#x20;

### Descartes' "Disastrous Classification"

Admittedly, though, even these efforts all too often end up doing more harm than good, as their architects inadvertently reify one certain outdated, even dangerous idea—an idea that British mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead termed the "Bifurcation of Nature”: René Descartes' "disastrous classification of substances into two species, bodily substance and mental substance"—in other words, the epistemological division between subject and object, self and other, nature and science (Whitehead, _Process_ 74). In remarkably ironic and damaging fashion to studies with embodied experience, this divide has plagued philosophy for centuries, often leaving even the most holistic think to have already, before even putting pen to to pad, withdrawn the agency from their subject's theoretical body, already pulled it out of its _lifeworld_ (Husserl 24).&#x20;

However, there is hope, yet; and it it is found primarily in the theoretical rebuttals, _contra-Descartes_, of a few contemporary anthropologists and philosophers.

## '_Relationality_' & Its Promise as a Suitable Framework

### _Content_ & _Context; the Whole-Organism-in-its-Environment_

For British anthropologist Gregory Bateson, this removal of agency, brought on as it was by Descartes, catalyzes a suicide of meaning: In borrowing the concepts of _content_ and _context_ from structural linguistics to draw out his theory on human-environment relations, he writes, "the word only exists as such—only has “meaning”—in the larger context of the utterance, which again has meaning only in a relationship” (Bateson, _Steps_ 410). With this, Bateson is suggesting that _meaning_ (i.e. content), does not, in fact, have meaning—is not _itself_—until it comes into _relation_ with the _context_ in which it is placed. Being, without being _in relation to_ a world, is an utterly meaningless abstraction for Bateson. His student, Tim Ingold, confirms this:

> In Bateson's account... information only exists thanks to the movement of the perceiver relative to his or her surroundings. Bateson constantly emphasised that stable features of the world remain imperceptible unless we move in relation to them... Through this \[eye] scanning movement we _draw_ distinctions, in the sense not of representing them graphically, but of ‘pulling them out’... the world opens out to the mind through a process of revelation. (Ingold, _Perception_ 18)

Similarly, Ingold views, "Organic life... \[as] active rather than reactive, the creative unfolding of an entire field of relations within which beings emerge and take on the particular forms they do, each in relation to the others." His theory of an "‘ecology of life'... \[accounts for] the whole-organism-in-its-environment. In other words, ‘organism plus environment’ should denote not a compound of two things, but one indivisible totality. That totality is, in effect, a developmental system" (Ingold, _Perception_ 19). This theoretical suture recasts the mind, which was altogether abstracted by Descartes, back into its original _livingness_:

> We do not... have to think of mind or consciousness as a layer of being over and above that of the life of organisms, in order to account for their creative involvement in the world. Rather, what we may call mind is the cutting edge of the life process itself, the ever-moving front of what Alfred North Whitehead (1929: 314) called a ‘creative advance into novelty'. (Ingold, _Perception_ 19)

Thus, for both Bateson and Ingold, the mind—its cognition and perceptions—is not, must not be displaced from its environment, defined by a delimiting border against it; for it is the relation to which that brings it to life, to meaning. Nor can the environment be closed off or abstracted away from the mind, lest emergence die and all becomes imperceptible. How closely this relationality recalls Maurice Merleau-Ponty's sentiments in _Phenomenology of Perception_:

> One must therefore reject as an abstraction any analysis of bodily space which takes account only of figures and points, since these can neither be conceived nor be without horizons... I am not in space and time, nor do I conceive space and time; I belong to them, my body combines with them and includes them... To be a body, is to be tied to a certain world, as we have seen; our body is not primarily in space: it is of it... We shall need to reawaken our experience of the world as it appears to us in so far as we are in the world through our body, and in so far as we perceive the world with our body. But by thus remaking contact with the body and with the world, we shall also rediscover ourself, since, perceiving as we do with our body, the body is a natural self and, as it were, the subject of perception. (Merleau-Ponty 115-16, 162, 170, 239)

### Envisioning the World Relationally &#x20;

While the holistic tone of this phenomenological model, with its dissolutions of dichotomies and commensurable vision, arrives wholesome, positive, even tensile, the truth is that this theoretical framework—as it accounts for every molecular mobilization in every moment of a given material plane—is, without exaggeration, nauseating in scale when we contemplate the proliferant nature immanent to its design. It is here that the famously labyrinthine Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari—whose synergistic, vibrating world will make many appearances in the pages to follow (and justice will still not be done to it)—bring the full raw scope of what a relational world looks like under the lens:&#x20;

> "... \[elements] are distinguished solely by movement and rest, slowness and speed. They are not atoms, in other words, finite elements still endowed with form. Nor are they indefinitely divisible. They are infinitely small, ultimate parts of an actual infinity, laid out on the same plane of consistency or composition. They are not defined by their number since they always come in infinities. However, depending on their degree of speed or the relation of movement and rest into which they enter, they belong to a given Individual, which may itself be part of another Individual governed by another, more complex, relation, and so on to infinity. There are thus smaller and larger infinities, not by virtue of their number, but by virtue of the composition of the relation into which their parts enter. Thus each individual is an infinite multiplicity, and the whole of Nature is a multiplicity of perfectly individuated multiplicities. The plane of consistency of Nature is like an immense Abstract Machine, abstract yet real and individual; its pieces are the various assemblages and individuals, each of which groups together an infinity of particles entering into an infinity of more or less interconnected relations. (Deleuze and Guattari, _Plateaus_ 254)&#x20;

This rhizomatic, sourceless fountainhead of relations is no doubt stimulating to theorize upon from a distance (_Plateaus_ 30); it is quite another to try and evince empirically, as mapping even five seconds of the phenomenological relations between, say, a running body (itself an assemblage of an infinite amount of multiplicities) and a trail (infinite more assemblages) would take years, lifetimes. But what is important here is not the impossibility of mapping the emergent relations in this phenomenon, but that it is indeed a _mapping_, an "affair of cartography", by which these relations can be understood or envisioned:

> Individual or group, we are traversed by lines, meridians, geodesics, tropics, and zones marching to different beats and differing in nature. We said that we are composed of lines... Or rather, of bundles of lines, for each kind is multiple... it should be borne in mind that these lines mean nothing. They compose us, as they compose our map. They transform themselves and may even cross over into one another. (_Plateaus_ 202-03)

Surely, this runner and the trail experienced through their five sense perceptions intimidate into aversion any containment-by-mapping. Just _one_ sense, should it somehow be parseable, would be a matter of bewilderingly frenetic lines gushing forth in infinite perpetual emergence; to and from no permanent destination (lines cannot be said to be definitively unidirectional, bidirectional, or multidirectional, or any combination of the three); each vibrating in varying magnitudes (perhaps every so often our runner hears from the trail cars passing by on a nearby road); simultaneously striking subadditive and superadditive quantities in their traversing one another; and constantly shifting relational touchpoints across the topographical landscape (which is, in fact, itself). Lines of affect everywhere forever always. And that is just _one_ sense. We have five, and they are all interconnected. Unfathomable are the permutations.&#x20;

Such are things when viewed relationally: infinitely complex integrations of multiplicities of assemblages (i.e. bundles of multiplicities of lines). And yet, our human experience of the world is not just frenetic and constant chaos; we are able to perceive and experience, to move through the phenomenal world, in more or less a state of equilibrium, or harmonious flow. Again Merleau-Ponty's sentiments ring resonant:

> I do not bring together one by one the parts of my body; this translation and this unification are performed once and for all within me: they are my body, itself... perception is always a reading off from the same sensory data, but constantly accelerated, and operating with ever more attenuated signals... our body is not an object for an ‘I think’, it is a grouping of lived-through meanings which moves towards its equilibrium. Sometimes a new cluster of meanings is formed; our former movements are integrated into a fresh motor entity, the first visual data into a fresh sensory entity, our natural powers suddenly come together in a richer meaning... (Merleau-Ponty 173, 176, 177)

Thus, while Deleuze and Guattari's philosophy (of which we've only scratched the surface) provides us a comprehensive view of the _relation machine_ that powers what we might call _the entire everything_, we are able to deploy their picture through the phenomenologically-focused insights of Merleau-Ponty, Bateson, and Ingold, and thereby bring a more precise awareness to _humanity_.

## How A Relational Habitus Begets _Agency_&#x20;

In light of Deleuze and Guattari's philosophical world, the complexity of the human body—the perception-mega-aggregator that it is—becomes more fully appreciated; truly, its baseline functioning is no less than performance art par excellence (_sans_ _effort_, no less). And yet, its marvel in this respect is so often passed over with attenuated descriptions akin to their being deterministic state machines, basic 1:1 computational designs—"I am hungry, so I eat". This is a highly misleading dilution of our body's potency, removed as it is from its true relational power; indeed, these inaccurate, impotent models of the body form the foundation of so many hegemonic and decelerating systems. We need to adopt at scale a more accurate model of embodiment.&#x20;

It is just here that a relational view of humanity, of the phenomenal world generally, injects its promise: this framework, when _lived_, allows for, encourages even, the training, the directional manipulation of these lines. That is to say, rather than move through life passively (and ignorantly) receiving and being affected by these phenomenal lines, when one embodies a relational habitus, insofar as it means living with an awareness of these lines, he or she may take hold of them, to directly engage with and maneuver life through them. In other words, a relational framework of the body reintroduces (from wherever it was last lost) _agency_ into our habitus. It opens out an existence where clear structural pathways present opportunities by which to activate agency.&#x20;

By this framework, we arrive to the following: an agent embodied in relational dynamism with the material, spatial environment with which it shares emergent manifestation; a dance shared across affective lines of perception that, in its unfolding, generates information and meaning, which is itself fed back into the web of relations to accelerate the unfolding emergences on their way.

## Making the Theoretical Leap to a True Relational Mode &#x20;

In many ways, the description above of the affective _body-environment relation machine_ is already how we intuitively understand the phenomenal world: at baseline, perception cannot take place without 1) some assemblage of a perceiving body: an apparatus with a processing system are requisite for the processing of 2) some assemblage or assemblages of stimuli: that which is perceived. In other words, to even meet the bare minimum qualifications of the possibility of perception, one must appreciate _as_ _necessary_ both the _content_—the body—and the _context_—its environment—of perceptual experience.

With that said, it is the theoretical leap, from holding content and context _as_ _necessary_ (only), to their sharing an _ontological_ _equality_—that is, they in and of themselves are evidently regarded as being _of equal value_—that will situate this book where it needs to go theoretically (we might recall Ingold here, that life "is not a compound of two things, but an indivisible totality”) (_Perception_ 19).&#x20;

Thus lays out ACEL's theoretical framework: one that, as will be shown, will open, rather than close; contain, rather than control. This model will offer an actionable ground from which ACEL's goals for humanity may lift off; a baseline from which this movement may accelerate our potential with deliberate and directed agency.
