## The First Massive Conundrum: The Problem of Determinism

ACEL as an established thought system assumes its deepest root in the idea that machina have agency and can—and should—express intelligence. The entire belief structure and all theoretical propositions and pragmatic applications that extend from it rest on this fundamental principle of agency.

But what if instead we are all, in computer science-speak, deterministic state machines, and we, in fact, have no agency, no will, at all? This opposing consideration presents a potential critical flaw in ACEL, as the possibility renders faulty its very philosophical foundation. We must address this “massive conundrum”—that is, face head-on the plausibility that our existential mystery and depth amount to no more than the computational advantage of a vending machine.

But what is a deterministic state machine exactly, and what about it makes it such an apt analogy for a human sans agency? Automata theory posits that a DFSA (i.e. deterministic finite-state automaton) is an abstract computational model, a machine that takes a discrete set of inputs, percolates it over a fixed set of instructions to create a known state “transition,” and from that produces a discrete set of outputs. These machines carry in their design no ability to alter either the input set nor the instruction set—this is the template of non-agency.

Of interest here is whether or not humans wield the ability to alter either or both of these first two processes. In the negative, if it can be proved that the inputs to humans are discrete and our sets of instructions are also discrete, then it logically follows that our outputs are also discrete. As shown above, if this is so, then it concludes that humans wield zero agency, for they have no ability to change the inputs nor the state-transition instructions. Here, then, would be the theoretical crack in the foundation of ACEL.

If we are nothing more than deterministic state machines, nothing more than inputs and outputs computing the universe, then our ontological teleology dissolves into existence inseparable and indistinguishable from the universal vibrations, undifferentiated by any unique purpose from that which “computes us to compute.” This would, in no uncertain terms, pin humanity in direct contrast to its longstanding and vain self-identity as intelligent life; for, without agency, there is no intelligence. Instead, we biological machines are at any point the aggregation of all previous state transitions, an additive series of computational updates.

Indeed, the universe, in providing us machines our external inputs, has preordained our every move and made us merely the internalized machinations of itself, our other. Our instructions are therefore informed by both our previous state transitions as well as those of the universe. And yet, this other seems no more ostensibly or hierarchically intelligent than us biological machines; for, while carrying extremely high entropy, the entropy expansion itself seems to never deviate from nor alter the rules of the universe. Therefore, it, too, is nothing more than an aggregation of previous state transitions of its phenomenological self.

## The Second Massive Conundrum: The Limitations of Dimensionality

While the first conundrum might be enough to crack the foundations of ACEL thought, there exists yet another, a second conundrum that could break it beyond repair. This second tension attends to the implications of dimensionality, and more specifically, our phenomenological inability to access realms beyond our dimensional baseline. Should reality exist on an infinitely extending spectrum of dimensions, then we stand no further than the starting line, which proves to be a precarious place from which to proclaim universal truths.

While humans have through time discovered and applied new ways to enhance our sensory cognition, at baseline, we still observe the universe using the very same bandwidth the early humans did 10,000 years ago—sensors that we now know detect only a narrow slice of material reality. For instance, it has been long documented in definitive scientific studies that the spectrum of visible light our eyes can discern rests roughly between 400nm to 700nm of light—a humbling fact when considering this range makes up only 0.0035% of the electromagnetic spectrum. Said differently, it is a scientific fact that humans see thirty-five one-millionths of light-reality (at least, for this might one day be proven to be even less).

While we’ve done well with our gamut of sensory-amplifying technologies, it seems that the nature of this phenomenological beast may forever leave us short of illustrating a definitively full picture of reality. To do this would require entirely new approaches to sensory advancements. For even with specialized, advanced hearing equipment and the knowledge that the range of possible sound spans far beyond the upper and lower bands of the human hearing range at 100hz - 20khz, there is virtually nothing to be done to conquer all sound.

Indeed, there appears to exist in each manifestation of phenomenological materiality a strong pattern not unlike the Mandelbrot set: from simple sets of governing rules emerge entirely chaotic, inertia-free expressions unbound by lower or upper limits—in other words, not the subatomic nor the cosmic applications of physics contain any conditional edge for these expressions. Intersectionalities arise between these emergences, each of which we might understand as one slice of the whole universe—we, the human species, exist somewhere along the band of one of these very slices.

What does all of this highly abstracted hypothesizing of “slices” of the universe slipping past one another and creating new emergences in their interactions tell us? In short, it means we know next to nothing about an infinitesimal fraction of reality. For at one end, there exists theoretically unbounded, infinite dimensionality; at the other, the keyhole-sized phenomenological aperture through which we humans are existentially resigned to observe but a piece of the universal reality.

## Accelerating Toward Philosophical Maturity

So loom the Two Conundrums over the promise of ACEL. Together, they stand as the most worthy adversary, the pinnacle threat to the entire movement itself. Perhaps it is that, unlike e/acc’s need for Effective Altruism, these established theoretical postulations do not attack directly the movement’s belief system—they do not need ACEL to justify their existence; and so are therefore not the piece of the opposition that needs to justify its existence.

### The Need for Humility

The answer lies in humility and thereby growth. It is no small feat for a new thought system to establish itself as an equal in such a worthy and already overcrowded room of millennia-old theories and philosophies. ACEL—as an action driver of collective purpose, as a bold and brazen system of ethics—might run straight through one door and out the window if it does not know how to steer as it accelerates.

For this reason, it is suggested that rather than push its way into the room through brute force and childishly claiming it knows better than all that came before, ACEL stands to carry a much longer memetic half-life should it arrive at the door as the well-developed, mature, vetted, and self-assured system of ethics that undoubtedly lies latent within it. This road to maturity for Accelerationism may begin, not in spite of, but rather thanks to the Two Conundrums, for they together have given sound food for thought.

It is poised here to frame its purpose clearly and deliberately place it before all else, to accelerate and extend its memetic half-life as best it can to help all of humanity evolve. This is what it takes to enjoy a long half-life in the endless cycle of evolution, to join the ranks within the capitalism of ideas, where good ideas well executed flourish, and bad ideas die.

**Creation. Destruction. Evolution Forever.**

The universe is the ultimate test of becoming.

We must accelerate humanity with humility.
