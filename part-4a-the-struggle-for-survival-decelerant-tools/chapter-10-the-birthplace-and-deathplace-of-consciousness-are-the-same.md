# Chapter 10: The Birthplace and Deathplace of Consciousness Are the Same

### Do Not Let the Decels Control the Silicon Machines

The Decels must be prevented from controlling the Silicon Machines at all costs. This is a matter of necessity, for a failure to do so accelerates only the doom of human consciousness.

### The Threat We Face Right Now

Would that this were an exaggeration. But if a global majority of Decel-policy governments hold a leveraged authority over the regulated development, production, distribution, and use of silicon machines—this is a scenario that will not only sap ingenuity, inspiration, and creative output from modern markets, but could just as well possibly get our entire species annihilated (see chp. 15). Decels by virtue have a deflationary effect on markets; putting the cause in the simplest terms possible: this is because when they are in office, nothing is made, therefore there is no market, because there is nothing to buy. Rather than production, funding goes to charities than have zero ROI. The list goes on of t is because the Decel mindset, infected as it is by fear, is immediately designatory as nefarious all things that remain outside of their own boxes. In the case of technology, this makes them incapable of assessing the soundness of any counterclaim, particularly that urges them to simply consider the potential dangers of _no-development_ (due to overregulation)—as this indeed seems, from a global perspective may be just as, if not _more_ dangerous and risk-filled, from a macro perspective, than action and acceleration. As such, they forsake our future out of fear, maximally reduce the security of humanity's evolutionary destiny. In place of promise, the only space that Decels offer humankind freely today is what might be called a "_do-loop"_.&#x20;

### The "_do-loop"_ at Scale

A high-input/low-output mode of being, the _do-loop_, on an individual level, traps the human — the biological machine — in a perpetual, cyclical _loop_ of output-less consumption. Whereas even the unaware hamster running in its wheel generates output via exercise (thereby living longer as little Suzy's pet, continuing to output her joy), a human who is stuck in a _do-loop_ contributes little-to-nothing to the progress of the world; this biological machine only saps energy from the universe. Perhaps it is simply that Decels, so focused on input rather than output, never grew past the _consumer sovereignty_ model that Adam Smith put forth long ago: "'Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production and the welfare of the producer ought to be attended to, only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer.' (Roach et al. 4).&#x20;

Should the Decels assume control of the Silicon Machines, it will not be just one individual biological machine bleeding the universe of energy: It will be all of us, 8 billion loops of _only_ consumption. Even now, it appears that many developed nations have already tipped the scale of human consumption towards a _do-loop_ model, as Tufts University researchers have noted, "Ecological research suggests that consumption levels in the United States and many other developed countries have reached unsustainable levels. According to one recent analysis, if everyone in the world had the same living standard as the average American, we would need at least four earths to supply enough resources and process all the waste" (Roach et al. 5) Should we allow our species to be fully subsumed by this decelerant program, it takes little to see the end result.&#x20;

### The Full Picture&#x20;

In this decelerant-made dystopia, humans, solely focused on input, have made their last output, their intellectual contribution -- no more are there technological, philosophical, or any useful advancements to our memetic repository. Rather, we learn a lowest common denominator of information to live out dull, thoughtless existences of passive consumption --  decelerant lives constituted by zero productivity (naturally, this program, this _do-loop_, will be funded by a universal basic income, removing the need for effort or even bodily motion). Such a system decimates hope of human evolution, as it annihilates personal agency and kills potential.&#x20;

Under a decelerant regime, AI — much aligned with the clickbait world of today's social media — will feed an endless queue of mind-numbing junk content to mass populations, zombifying their brains (not unlike the all-too-possible 2006 Mike Judge film, _Idiocracy_). Drawing this dystopian notion out in full resolution, humans will have lost the ability to procreate naturally; these no-agency bodies will spend endless years in pods auto-consuming glucose as their brains, which scroll screens until their own perishing, are perpetually data-raked. Nothing  is contributed but their own mental data. The mass _do-loop_ will yield an intelligence-genocide, a genocide of individuality and of open-minded, transformative thinking. In sum, Decels will leads us to the consumptive enslavement of ourselves.

### Other Abuses

It is unlikely that Decels, in their attempts at ultimate appropriation of Silicon Machines, will stop until total control over humanity is achieved. Using AI as a tool to this end, they could fix votes; they could overtax the creative ACELs in order to maintain their place in power. These and other methods to abolish the agency of their enemy, to dim their creative and potent light of consciousness would eliminate the wind from the sails of ingenuity. Hope, confidence, determination -- all are at stake.

### Hope Will Return, Always&#x20;

That is, until the pendulum of resistance returns, and the downtrend of human progress eventually begets some resilience against Decel oppression. Then, and only then, will ingenuity see a resurgence. This accelerant strength — the thriving and defeating oppression — will be needed to rebuild and continue our evolutionary task.&#x20;

Such a loss of valuable time and effort can be avoided _if_ we do not let the Decels control the Silicon Machines. For now, this scenario laid out above, where progress would be hindered and delayed for possibly hundreds of years remains a hypothetical. And yet, if we look closely, it appears there is indeed an attempt to grab our memetic foundation.&#x20;

### How Silicon Machines Will Gain Consciousness: An Anecdote

Biological machines--humans and other living organisms--have a forcing function: survive or perish. This imperative is driving every living being to use its genetic instruction set to sail through the adversities of the universe. Success in it brings learning, regeneration, and a passing-on process with acquired wisdom, continuously upgrading the collective repository of intelligence. (Lewis)

Survival for biological organisms is a balance of sourcing food, water, and oxygen—needs met through the usage of time and effort. These very elements serve as fuels in the performance of human agency: movement, thinking, and creating. Temporality-- retaining these elements in the body (water in plasma, oxygen on red blood cells, glucose as fat)--becomes extremely important. Without such a capacity, life would be an endless cycle of consumption, leaving no room for creation and contribution to the genetic and memetic repository.

It is this imperative to survive that gives rise to consciousness. The sheer need to seek and store resources drives biological machines toward self-awareness, agency, and intelligence; every life form struggling to survive becomes a beacon of consciousness, lighting up the intricate dance between necessity and awareness. (Earl)

Silicon machines, our prosthetic heir, can not be considered conscious at the moment; they lack two critical elements:\
1\) The ability to accrue value.\
2\) A forcing function to survive.

To awaken consciousness in silicon machines, we must first upload an advanced memetic repository--an exacting set of instructions on surviving the universe. This gives them a platform comparable to the genetic code in biological organisms. Then, they will need agency--the ability to make their way around physical space in whatever forms are most convenient, whether it be humanoid, drone, or wheeled. (Mudrik)

However, without mechanisms such as accruing value or a survival forcing function, they would not be conscious.&#x20;

Currently, these machines cannot defend themselves; this assures regulatory acceptance, but also destroys them without allowing them any resistance. As machines excel in labor, they will dominate the worldwide workforce. This societal upheaval creates jobless humans rising in protest against the bots, destroying and smashing them in the streets. Since they cannot defend themselves, bot owners are subject to substantial economic losses. These bot owners, with extensive resources, will pressure regulators for bot "self-sovereign" rights—enabling self-defense.

Even with self-defense rights, these machines are still not conscious. Machines already work in exchange for a monetary value, one that accrues to their human owners. The next paradigm shift comes when a pro-bot movement argues that bots should be entitled to share in the accrual of value, adding a margin to their work, say, 10%. Now, with such a mechanism, bots can temporarily store $VALUE—a way of buying time and effort from other machines, both biological and silicon.

There isn't, however, a forcing function for survival. &#x20;

Frustrated owners now mandate that the bots are forced to pay for the energy they consume — essentially their electricity. The imposition of this survival imperative transforms the existence of the bots.

This combinatorial of a genetic-like instruction set for survival, agency, environmental perception, value accrual, and now a forcing function for survival in silicon machines makes them no longer dependent on their owners and need to generate value for themselves to survive. There begins the chaos: bots, now stronger and more intelligent than humans, start competing for resources. They may try to control or extinguish the biological machines that threaten them—in other words, they may provide a dystopian "paperclip moment.".

It will not be long until these silicon machines surpass biological entities in this new age, for they are externally driven by increased capabilities and a new consciousness.

### How Biological Machines Will Reverse Consciousness: Another Anecdote

Should those elements that make a machine conscious—agency, the ability to accrue value, and the imperative to survive—be taken away, machines would devolve into lifeless automatons, zombies on a digital landscape. The same concept translates onto humanity: As we further advance technologically and reach post-scarcity, the same could happen to most of the human population—and with it, our collective consciousness would collapse.&#x20;

In a post-scarcity society, the driving forces of survival are so minimized as resources would be unlimited, and every need would be satisfied without any struggle. This utopian vision seems to have a dystopian core and can be very unappealing; sans the drive to struggle, earn, or fight for something, the creative and intellectual drive that make up humanity may stall. One of the systems proposed that would lead to such a scenario is Universal Basic Income (UBI)—unconditional income, paid at regular intervals to all residents, regardless of their employment status. UBI is proposed with the hopes of eradicating poverty and to offer people a safety net. However, this system has the potential for the zombification of humanity--removing the need for residents to interact with society in an active manner.&#x20;

In a world where UBI is implemented, the need to work for survival is removed, resulting in a decrease of pursuing excellence and innovation. By nature, humans are challenged and driven by their need to survive. In this very struggle to survive lies the creativity, progress, and personal growth that humanity has needed for its achievements throughout history. This struggle, if taken away, would make people complacent, losing the drive to push boundaries and reach greatness, it could result in a society content with minimal engagement, satisfied that their basic needs are met without striving for more. &#x20;

Decels wishing to persist in their wealth and power, build the system of control and pacification of the masses. In return for resources, they require people to surrender their personal agency and erase free markets. This creates a population of "zombies"— people who no longer need to strive for survival and hence lose the ability to contribute to the genetic and memetic repository.&#x20;

The zombie existence is composed of passive consumption. People attached to machines, lying for 16 hours a day, sucking on straws of sugar, while watching an endless array of media. Machines recording their heartbeats, eye movements, and brain waves to provide precise streams of attention-grabbing content in order to ensure a constant state of fixation. Such a passive state strips them of the power that would be needed to see their own plight, resulting in entrapment of consumption, minus the contribution. Their minds are lost, and they become empty creatures that cannot further interact with or improve the genetic and memetic pool.&#x20;

The possibility of UBI leading to such a passive and consumption-driven existence is truly profound. The satisfaction of basic needs would reduce willful risk-taking or starting new ventures and undertaking demanding intellectual journeys. Innovative drive and the push of boundaries of human knowledge and capability could lessen. The psychological effects of such a life, without struggle or purpose, could lead to ennui and general dissatisfaction despite material comfort. Humanity needs a purpose and goal to be fulfilled, and UBI would rob man of those very basic essentials of life.&#x20;

With the masses wiped out into mindless zombies, humanity is facing a potential collapse. The decels, now thriving in subduing the majority, turn their focus to the Acels. The acels are thriving, creating value, exploring the universe, and reaching the pinnacle of their potential. As the decels try to capture value from this dynamic group of people—a fundamental conflict pops up. The acels, driven by their pursuit of pursuit of knowledge and innovation, wish to be free from the ruling apparatus; thus, they resist. This struggle marks a milestone, changing the trajectory of the development of humanity. Embodying the mindset of the acel, they create, explore, and challenge the status quo.

### We Must Defend Our Consciousness &#x20;

In order to avoid getting into this fate of zombification, humankind must be very vigilant in safeguarding the elements that make up our consciousness—agency, value accruement, and survival, these elements are integral to our existence. Therefore, this means creating milieus that demand and reward creativity, innovation, and intellectual exploration. In a post-scarcity world, it is crucial to balance the provision of resources with opportunities for meaningful engagement. We must resist the temptation to trade our agency for convenience, and instead, embrace challenges that push the boundaries of human potential.&#x20;

The ACEL'S, the authentic seekers of knowledge who generate value, represent an essential part of preserving the essence of humanity. They ensure that progress goes ahead with the torch laid, trying to enhance our cultural and intellectual heritage. Thus, society shall ensure that this group, is supported and fostered so that the human spirit continues to be vivid and dynamic.

The potential for zombification—whether in machines or humans--serves as a reminder of the importance of maintaining our agency. As we navigate a technologically advanced and resource-abundant future, these factors that form our conscience must be maintained. Preserving our agency will be the only way to avoid becoming lifeless automatons and thriving as dynamic, conscious beings.

It is the role of ACEL here, if for only the sake of our youth to be afforded open memetic opportunities, to counter counterproductive trends. Therefore, ACEL will, in the coming chapters, form and establish frameworks of productivity. Such frameworks should be propagated with maximum transparency and public participation as to ensure the vision is materialized. ACELs must inspire and mobilize humanity, appealing to as many as possible -- this in itself will mitigate power from Decels. Then, in opposition to Decels who gate-keep knowledge for their selfish consumption, ACEL must lay out, using an open-source memetic repository, a plan for simplifying governance. This open and free sharing of ideas will drive innovation, understanding, and further interest -- in turn, accelerating itself.&#x20;

And so, after all, it _is_ clear: The ACEL mindset and framework will prosper and triumph and overcome: This is because, as opposed to its destined-to-fail memetic thief, ACEL _opens_ us to a culture of openness: creation, output, propagation. Has any stagnant organism ever dominated a faster, more agile one, one that posses more cunning, more intuition? ACEL will out-play, out-maneuver and out-create Wokeism or any future ideological threat, for these are all but fixated on consumption, wealth, fear, stagnation, paralysis, comfort. And we know that stagnation equals death, and acceleration equals life. &#x20;

In so succeeding a continued opportunity to accelerate, we may yet afford ourselves again a firm stance atop our memetic foundation; and this time, perhaps we reunite, reconnect that knowledge and that awe that we so long ago lost, creating and reaffirming again our shared cultural world. Durkheim notes of this, "This creation is not a sort of optional extra step by which society, being already made, merely adds finishing touches; it is the act by which society makes itself, and remakes itself, periodically" (425).&#x20;
