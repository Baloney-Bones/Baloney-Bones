# Chapter 12: The School of ACEL

Recall from chapter 1 the _nothing-else-matters_ value that ACEL places on the proper support and raising of children—the ensuring that all children receive prioritized, empathetic, attentive structures within which they are raised and educated. This is because ACEL’s respect of, care for, and positive encouragement of children is the only topic in its purview that rivals its noble purpose: ‘the survival and evolution of humanity’ in importance. And, when placed adjacent, is it not clear why? Are _children_, and _the survival and evolution of humanity_, _not_, in fact, one and the same? Is it not the case that children are in fact, those next in line to take ownership of their own humanity? of those who will _receive_ _our_ _humanity_? Such is the reason for the placement of _parenting_ in the front and center of the this book.

## A Broken Education Model

#### And a Brief Tirade About It

And yet, the public school system—those same organizations who require of their teachers to claim themselves _in loco parentis,_ on paper, by law, write large—_—_utterly fail to produce anything that even resembles a parental—even a teacher, for that matter. It is by this that they fail, in pathetic fashion, the movers of our future. Save for a few nations like Singapore, Finland, and Japan, these ineffectual, overcrowded, understaffed school systems, of which the U.S. might act as archetype, by the mouth of their embodied extensions—their administrators—make excuses for record-breakingly low test scores. More, they model this Decel, no-ownership behavior in front of the children for which they deem themselves parent-by-extension; this is, with finality, embarrassing and decelerating to humanity. It is within these buildings—for, they are not worth reification as _school_; shelter appears to be all they are good for—that these admins visibly show to these young people (who are much more perceptive than they’re given due), how much they _don’t_ matter, with every their bureaucratic appeasing of its union bully and continuing to employ disgraces who call themselves teachers. It is such an utter comprehensive failure on human integrity, and who is to tell these children that it’s not their fault? that they are worth teaching well?

While this is a sweeping and affective tirade, it of course knows there are many big-hearted, effective-teaching saints walking who are and will always be heroes to their students, and they know who they are; ACEL speaks mainly of the administrators and the feet-on-desk “tenured” teachers, who also know who they are.

Here the vent ends and precise zones of issue in public schools will be listed and examined, after which solutions will be proposed.

### Zones of Issues

> 1._Ethos of Standardization_

> 2._No Accounting for Individuality in Studies_

> 3._Outdated Curriculum_

> 4._Lack of Appropriate Learning Equipment_

#### 1. Ethos of Standardization

Standardization is pedagogy-speak for Centralization; it is a centralizing system based in the ethos of alignment. It might be no surprise that the Standardized Test is built off none other than the World War I Army Alpha Test, which was created to screen and place American soldiers in combat depending on their IQ. Because it was a test distributable to masses of troops, it introduced a scalable model of testing. So, today, ten years past the WWI centennial, we trade meaningful assessment for literally meaningless convenience—our 5th graders are not being placed for the infantry in the Battle of the Somme. While a hyperbolic sarcasm, there is nothing to laugh about ranking 38th in Mathematics, currently where the United States sits. To sum up, we oughtn’t give army tests to middle schoolers.

Such a model of standardized education is doing a disservice to what the youth are able to do. It is a relic that must be dismantled and reimagined. It is only then that one will have an educational environment that nourishes the whole person, respects his or her uniqueness, and utilizes the full spectrum of modern tools available to make learning more effective. Much of the future of education depends on how much change and innovation we are willing to undergo in the preparation of a system as dynamic and diverse as the pupils it serves.

**Recommendation: Remove Standardized Testing**

#### 2. No Accounting for Individuality in Studies

While perhaps sweeping, by and large, if a parent wants their child to be understood regarded as a “whole person”, with conflicting interests that come and go and the school accommodates and individualizes their studies—they are going to have to pay handsomely for that. For, the sad truth is, public schools either don’t have the bandwidth due to overcrowded schools, or they do not have the quality educators that will open these spaces to students; or both. Private schools whose tuition costs $30k/year and class sizes of 12:1; those are where the “whole student” is considered. It is a shame; all children deserve this model of learning, for it absolutely is effective.

One would think from first principles this is a given—far from it. And really, a major piece holding this particular struggle back is not the system itself, directly; it is teachers unwillingness to accommodate student needs. This is all the more reason that the autonomy of the teacher’s union must be sized back. In this way, for example, a “set-in-his-ways” teacher who assigns reading homework in a book, and refuses to allow a student asking to read it in an OCR PDF that accommodates her diagnosed severe dyslexia. She tries to read the book and can’t; she fails her quiz. The next day he makes fun of her in front of the class saying, “I guess paper turns the words upside down, huh?” Naturally, as this will not be his first transgression; he will be fired. There are excellent, empathetic, and eager teachers out there seeking jobs. Set their memes free.

**Recommendation: Support Individuality**

#### 3. Outdated Curriculum

While the Common Core Standards was updated in 2010, the majority of the public school curriculum is a residual skeleton of the early to mid-1800s. While there have been improvements over time; they are far from perfect and still are incapable of addressing the individualized needs of each student.

While private schools are seeing an emergence of more flexible study systems, the public school system has yet to find a way to scale best practices, which reside primarily within active and interdisciplinary learning models. This pedagogical shift from sedentary, rote, one-dimensional to vibrant, high-impact, multi-disciplinary journeys of growth and discovery must find its way into these public school buildings. If successful, these schools may be able to truly maximize the potential of each student.

**Recommendation: Active & Interdisciplinary Learning Models/Best Practices**

#### 4. Lack of Digital Equipment

As the plethora of issues surrounding public school funding are far too complex for the scope of this chapter, suffice it to say, public school schools ought to prioritize—in the full sense of that word—embracing the tools of the digital age and fostering a culture of continuous improvement. This new model will not only prepare them for the challenges of the modern world but also empower them to shape the future with confidence and creativity.

Our recommendation is based on the supposition that financial packages going to teachers unions are financial packages _not_ going to student educative materials such as digital equipment. Passing Right-to-Work laws will destabilize the financial revenue of over-powerful teacher’s unions (insofar as they prohibit requiring dues). Getting teacher’s unions out of vulnerable school systems, which is coincidentally where the greatest dearth of digital equipment exists, this will open up capital for things like computers, smart boards, and tablets—even something as basic as reliable internet might become available to more students should more states pass these laws.

**Recommendation: Petition Respective State to Pass Right-to-Work Laws**

## The Fix: Method; Philosophy; & Why Parents Will Choose The School of ACEL

While the active dedication of one’s agency to the improvement of the public school system at large is a noble cause if there ever was one, ACEL—for itself—brings to the initiative of improving primary and secondary education levels its own educational model. Currently still in concept, below are laid out in distinct lists the values and principles composing its core philosophy, as well as the logistical features of its basic methodology.

### Method

#### Setting

* One large, open circular auditorium with reliable, constant internet connection (e.g. Starlink). Educational booths line circular perimeter (one seat per); room’s center remains open for student exchange between classes.

#### Daily Routine

* Each student receives high-stimulation 1:1 instruction in booth via AI-enhanced delivery systems.
* The student enters the system each school day, and is guided on a rotating field of education, which proceeds as such: a short, 20-minute bout of high-stimulation delivery; 10 minutes of testing; move on to next subject. This rapid rotation of subject matter is intended to maintain engagement. (Fast and immediate testing serves two purposes; 1) to train the uptake of the material, and 2) to pulse-check the progress of the child’s uptake. This would allow extremely personalized content delivery at the rate at which the child has demonstrated to learn, and may change at any time.

#### Individualized & Customizable

1. For themselves, the AI tutors—credible and revolutionary in personalized education—provide for students an impossibly smooth learning experience, much as they are adaptive coaches that learn the student while the student learns content. That is to say, the AI tutor observes and tracks in real-time the student’s individualized style of learning, including strengths and areas to improve; by this, they are able to continuously adjust their teaching strategy to the unique needs of each child, giving individualized feedback modified to suit each child’s social-emotional needs.
2. While 1:1 tutoring may not be necessary or required at every stage, it will be perpetually available and serves as a great supplementary asset.

#### Level-Based System

1. All ages learn together, literally, in that this is a one classroom environment; but also academically, in that The ACEL School implements a level-based system. This will dissolve notions of hierarchies and hegemonies, especially so with a system that transcends the static superiority-by-age complex. This thus becomes a multi-dimensional learning environment, where at once students will be learning content appropriate to their level, while also learning far more complex social-emotional skills than they would in traditional educational settings.

### Philosophy (& Why Parents Will Choose the School of ACEL)

ACEL believes that in a free market of educational models, it would be the parents who determine which educational models thrive and which fade. For, at the heart of the ACEL School lies not only in an appreciation for individualized agency-by-education, but also for the parents’ expectations of the institution—this often attendant to a scope of innovative yet practical learning for transformation. Should this be found to be a parent’s mode in their search for the right educational environment for their child, we’ve laid out the following conviction as to why the ACEL School might be the environment they seek for the education of their children:

#### The Holism of Teaching to the Memetic Repository

The memetic repository learn cycle is one that differentiates vastly from a traditional curriculum that mostly serves only to reify subjects as discrete, dislocated abstractions. In contract, teaching to the memetic repository is a contextual, holistic enterprise developing in all directions simultaneously. For example, mathematics flows into music; history raises questions of ethics; scientific inquiry prompts philosophical debate. Doing this at the baseline level dissolves early on misleading notions of the memetic world as static and dislocated; instead, this model encourages from youth contextual perspectives.

#### A “whole person” focus

The ACEL School cultivates individual human potential by focusing on the development of their _whole person_. That is to say, in addition to academics, the program in active ways attends to a students’ social, emotional, and life skills; “meets students where they are” insofar as it tailors teaching methods to needs and develops individualized learning plans; and dedicates uninterruptible space for students to explore their passions.

The ACEL School is designed to adapt to each child’s individual pace of learning, offering a reflexive model that can move as rapidly or deliberately as the student and family desire. It is precisely this flexibility of the ACEL School toward meeting each child’s individual needs that will enable parents to tailor their children’s education. Whether a child is accelerated in any particular subject or more time is needed to develop mastery, or both—ACEL eagerly accommodates this. Further, the school’s commitment to tending to natural gifts and developed interests contributes toward all round education that will help them in personal and professional life.

As such, the ACEL School is able to offer a curriculum that places much-needed attention on the development of the whole person: fostering emotional intelligence, critical thinking, and creativity with academic skills.

#### Compassion

The methodology of The ACEL School is grounded in a compassion for all humanity: that all manifest agencies are never to be judged, only supported and respected as worthy of that agency. As this virtue is intrinsic to the model of learning, it is not just about raising knowledgeable beings but also healthy, happy, and superbly adjusted members of society. Compassion breeds coordination in all stakeholders: teachers, parents, and AI-powered tutors working together to accomplish a common objective.

This is a system of education where every decision is taken by considering first, the welfare of the child. Such is foundation on how the curriculum is set, how we train staff, how we design assessments, etc. This approach ensures that education is always perceived by its protagonist—the student—as a net positive, as one nurturing and an fostering experience that prepares them with a well of confidence and agency for tackling life’s coming challenges and seizing all of its opportunities. The ACEL Schools sees compassion as contagious: ours will lead to theirs, and will disperse this encouraging memetic throughout the world.

#### Collaborative, Open Approach

Education does not exist in a teacher:student vacuum but is a collaborative effort between parents, schools, and the broader community. In ACEL’s vision, this is a seamless partnership based in mutualism. Advanced communication tools and shared educational platforms that offer real-time performance metrics—both the triumphs and the struggles—make sure parents and educators are always on the same page in working together for the growth of the child. This joint effort—compassionate and mutually respectful in nature—furthers a positive learning environment that reinforces the well-being of the whole person.

Unlike traditional schools, where the curriculum is literally a mandate from the state, ACEL School provides an incredibly open alternative to education. In this open model, parents can “toggle” different aspects of the curriculum to align with family values and their child’s interests. Such high customizability enables parents to take an active role in their children’s education, ensuring that the schooling reflects their cultural, ethical, and intellectual priorities. In addition, this adaptability of the design means that the ACEL School will be able to handle changes in priority regarding education or any new technological development seamlessly, so that the learning experience always remains relevant and engaging.

#### Affordability

Perhaps one of the most compelling reasons parents will be attracted to the ACEL School is the affordability of education. By further leveraging AI to truly systematize and automate administrative tasks, personalize learning, and lower overhead costs, ACEL Schools could provide high-quality education at a lower cost. This price point accessibility gives more families, especially those with lower incomes, the opportunity to give their children an exceptional educational experience without experiencing excessive tuition fees. The use of AI not only reduces costs but also enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of the educational process, allowing for more resources to be directed towards enriching the student experience.

#### Proof of Success in Alternative Models

Montessori schools and the like have already proven that there is, in fact, space for new educational systems, ones that offer a distinctly differentiated approach than the traditional model. ACEL Schools intend to deepen this moat with their incorporation of advanced technologies and unique personalized learning approaches that answer the diverse needs of today’s students. Knowing that alternative models have been effective, parents may feel much more confident about the ability of the ACEL School to handle their child; it will be less an experiment, more another option.

Ultimately, parents will opt for ACEL School because it gives an adaptable, efficient, involved, affordable, and empowering education. ACEL Schools put family and child needs and preferences at the forefront, binding educators and parents together for the best service of interest to their student. This kind of collaborative approach makes education a journey, respecting parental insight and aspiration while equipping learners with tools and support to create successful lives. All this to say, The ACEL School may well be among the most alluring possibilities for parents seeking excellent, affordable, holistic, and agency-activating education. In the free market of ideas, The ACEL School, by virtue of its philosophy, stands confident in its ability to stand the test of time.

The ACEL School motto: It is through learning that one learns the best version of themself; then, they must choose to become so.

### ACEL’s ‘Self-Progress Report’ to Parents

Much like in PTO Meetings, where a teacher and parent(s) might review their child’s general approach to school (e.g. always bright and engaged, shy around others, etc.), more attuned notes in class (e.g. participates, falls asleep, etc.), participation level and so forth, always the most prevalent topic is some sort of progress report of the student’s academic strengths and weakness. Here we turn this around and give ACEL its own “Self-Progress Report”; and, though not academic, if schools assess student’s in this way, why are we not assessed in some similar manner, as well? We think prospective parents who might find some initial resonance with ACEL’s educational model ought to see what ACEL thinks about itself, and may appreciate its honest self-review. This will be a process of self-discovery, for ACEL, as well.

We believe this should be done before it arrives to the stage and presents public invitation. The ACEL School is genuinely curious of public interest in this program; if you are interested, please do reach out. This is all done in the name of the potential benefit of kids being in a space that is highly engaging, challenging to their level, specified, at so on. It is all about whether or not your child would feel most comfortable in this type of educational setting, and thus be able to truly engage with it and activate intelligence by it; for, at the end of the day, it is not about us, it is about the student. As such, we’ll perform an open-air self-progress report using a bottom-up methodology—i.e. there is no predetermined conclusion about what the final result will be—once we have laid out all of what ACEL _is_ and _is_ _not_, what it has to offer and what it does not, then it may line up its assets and liabilities and consider with which memetic framework might be best for it to self-identify, and if it is indeed worthy of a long fruitful half-life.

### Acknowledging the Tricky Part First

Before beginning this self-audit, we must first, as adult readers, recognize that ACEL, despite having the structural legs of a tried and tested memetic powerhouse, is still in its early adolescence; it is full of intensity and potential, and it may not yet know itself to the full extent of, say, its mature educational philosophy. Patience and empathy are required with it; and, easily done by recollecting one’s bygone teenage years, we might encourage ACEL to be deliberate in the steps it takes while carving out its own schooling path. For it, not you, is what matters.

This heeding is not a deceleration but a calling attention to focus; for, with so much buzzing intensity, all that charged, world-improving potential it can barely contain inside itself, it is imperative that ACEL not waste or dissipate itself with a lack of focus. It has too much to offer; and therefore it must put effort in ensuring that its energies are channeled, not frenetic; its aim sharpened, not erratic. If it can maintain these qualities through its launch into the memetic marketplace, then it stands to truly live the full extent of its half-life potential.

The reasoning behind this parental finger-wg is that ACEL, as has been shown, may wish to model itself after the Meme Infallible. By its whole nature, this would make sense: Why wouldn’t ACEL aim to model itself on the longest half-life, the strongest, most infallible memetic structure that is Religion? In and of itself, this is no issue; however, historical context tells us differently, that in fact there is very tricky territory to navigate here, as historical precedent has shown us the following: that those thought systems who have previously attempted to mime the Meme Infallible, that is, Religion, quickly and inevitably fall into the pit of “cults”. This is _not_ where we want ACEL, nor any memetic structure with such enormous potentiality to end up; it is not where ACEL _should_ wind up.

Thus, the reasoning for the bottom-up self-audit. Does ACEL, in fact, have what it takes to fly over the “pit of cults” and successfully _mime the unmemeable_? Only the self-audit can say. Regardless of the outcome, a guiding question of this exercise might ask the following: If there were a way, what would it look like for any full-of-promising memetic structure go about applying what _is possible_ of the memetic strengths of Religion, _without_ ever claiming to be one, or _without_ ever being mistaken as an attempt to be one? Without further ado.

## ACEL’s Self-Audit

This exercise aims to present the public with an open-air self-progress of ACEL’s “Assets & Liabilities”. The purpose behind this voluntary showing of strengths and areas for improvement is to model an organic and earnest pursuit to find the optimal memetic framework in which to propose situating ACEL. It should be reiterated here just before beginning that this is being performed via a bottom-up and first principles methodologies, that there is no prior knowledge or motive of where ACEL “ought to” belong prior to start. Any parallelisms are by pure providence. Let’s begin.

### Assets

*
* **Clearly Defined Purpose**
* To secure and ensure that the evolution of humanity is seen through to its full completion.
* Of its own volition, ACEL created this its _raison d’etre_, and throughout itself retains focus on this foundational, frequently-referenced imperative. In fact, ACEL presents itself as being worthy of existence _only_ for this reason; it does not exist without this anchor. This purpose has easy buy-in and can, from a high level, be propagated easily.

**Complete Metaphysical Picture**

* Grand Design: Biological Machines -> Silicon Machines -> Energy Machines -> Universal Machine (-> back to beginning?)
* ACEL, despite its youth, has a full and complete metaphysical picture informed by historical biology, economic theory, quantum theory, process theory, religious studies, contemporary theory in the social sciences. This includes but is not limited to: a thorough attendance to the physical nature of reality and a consideration of our insignificance; an ultimate reason for our existence and the universe as well as its antithesis; a philosophical attendance to Time, Space, Reality, & Relationality.

**Praxis-Based Methodology**

*
* accelerate human intelligence —> maximize human agency —> complete humanity’s evolutionary cycle
* Comment
* ACEL posits many various, yet all essential, actionable approaches aligned with its purpose. Methods are heavily variegated. A small sample: implementation of Mises-based free-market capitalism in all realms of exchange; maintain peace at all costs with Biological-Silicon Machines; intentionality in genetic and memetic reproduction; initiate alternative schooling system; begin at-scale space exploration.

**Clear Moral Guidelines**

* “If the action accelerates human intelligence & improve the security of human evolution, according to ACEL thinking, then the action is moral.”
*
* ACEL proposes the this moral compass to guide our behaviors. Simple, direct, and utilitarian in nature, it emphasizes individual potential and the development of one’s agency. Guidelines maintain emphasis on importance of raising children: As they are more capable to possess a wider repository of genes and memes, we are only to guide them, ever-attentive to the fact that they have an innate potential to exceed our capabilities. Guidelines exists outside the bounds of traditional religious morality or new State morality. There is no exclusionary ideology against any group except the Decels.

**Temporally Situated with Origin Story**

* We are nearing a point where we must make Existential Leap, a significant turning point in the course of the universe’s memetic knowledge.
* Comment
*
* ACEL bestows upon humanity a substantial significance in the past, present, and future of the universe. We are important agents and have a role to play in the unfolding of all things.
* **Tone of Optimism**
*
* ACEL embodies an optimism in outlook via an unwavering confidence deeply set in its system, that we are in fact capable of achieving the goal set out for us. We can actually fulfill our purpose.

### Liabilities

* **Full Curriculum Build Needed**
* **Teacher / Staff Training Program Needed**
*
* **Potential Misunderstandings/Misinterpretation**
* ACEL carries within its name a potential for being labeled “guilty-by-association” risk to success, based on the history of Accelerationism’s public image be herded in with other groups of Accelerationism, at least at first. This poses a and those violent sects who’ve misguidedly taken the name. ACEL will need to frequently reiterate through public discourse that it actively plots an entirely different course than all other groups who’ve preceded it, even e/acc. It should recount that the only two items in common are the name, and the priority of “output”.
*
* **Clearly Defined Enemy**
*
* Borrowed from e/acc thinking, ACEL has a well-defined abstract enemy, Decelerants (i.e. Decels), which serve as a clear framework for rejection.
*

### Conclusion of Self-Progress Report

Taken altogether,

In this way, ACEL may still enjoy a long and healthy half-life; for, as a coherent framework with a clearly stated purpose and other guiding systems, it is certainly _something_. And here we might extend that question: what _is_ ACEL, exactly? To answer this, Taken together, these defining features encourage a classification of ACEL as

Thus we have a framing by which ACEL may confidently move into and through the world,

With this new self-knowledge, ACEL finds itself equipped with intelligence at both hips, ready to share its observations of humanity and its longview of agented evolution.
