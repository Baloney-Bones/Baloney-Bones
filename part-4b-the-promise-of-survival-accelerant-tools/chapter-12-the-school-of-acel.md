# Chapter 12: The School of ACEL

### A Broken Education Model

The current model of public education is standardized by the State, and it

Inefficient and Slow.

In a world where change is the only constant, the public education model remains a relic of a bygone era. A system based on state-standardized curricula, such as this, is like a lumbering leviathan that does not have the dexterity to cope with today's rapid changes. Such a framework does not react hastily at all because it is dragged by bureaucratic inertia and a rigid framework, leaving the students handcuffed to past paradigms. All the while, time will seem to stand still within these walls, while outside the classroom, the world will continue changing exponentially, trapping the young mind in a vortex of obsolescence.

In a monolithic structure of state standardized education, the system overlooks the tapestry formed vividly by a pupil's skills and interests. Within each child is a ton of potential, as they brim with uniqueness. But the education system, in zeal for uniformity, often kills this very diversity by fitting students into some homogenized mold. Indifference to individuality not only kills creativity but dampens intrinsic motivation, which drives genuine learning. Students have become no more than cogs in a machine; their personal growth and potential are sacrificed at the altar of standardization.&#x20;

The present model of education utterly fails to build a "whole person." Standing alongside this emphasis on rote memorization and standardized testing is a complete lack of development of critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and emotional intelligence. This narrow focus is reminiscent of the factory model from which it originated—designed to produce compliant workers rather than thoughtful, engaged citizens:. This erodes the soul and goal of education: the nurture of well-rounded individuals able to navigate life's complexities.

This is Based on a Model Approved by… Whom?

One must ponder, who approved this model, and by what criteria? The current system is an artifact of the industrial age, crafted to meet the needs of a time long past.

It was designed by and for a society that valued conformity over creativity, obedience over innovation. The curriculum mirrors the interests of policymakers and bureaucrats, many of whom are isolated from the needs of students and the changing requirements of the modern world. In this kind of structure, which lacks transparency and utilizes stakeholder engagement in shaping educational standards, lies a heritage that is increasingly out of sync with reality.

With technology offering us unprecedented opportunities in individualized and adaptive learning, it is a real surprise that the schools resist change and are not utilizing numerous new tools at our disposal to the fullest. Sophisticated educational technologies, digital resources, and personalized learning platforms could make an incredible change in education if used effectively to engage, and would help make the education process more effective. Yet, the system still clings tenaciously to those traditional ways of operations—much like an anchored ship in a turbulent sea who cannot set sail on new horizons. Refusal to adopt innovations limits such educational experiences and leaves students poor at tools that would enhance their journey of learning.

A Call for Transformation

With these deep flaws, there is no denying that the current model of public education urgently needs a philosophical and practical redesign. We cannot allow ourselves to be shackled by the constraints of a homogenized, cookie-cutter model of education, if young minds are to be prepared both for the adversities and opportunities that lie ahead. Education should be dynamic, individualistic, holistic—having as much to do with emotional and moral _intelligence_ as academic mastery.

There needs to be a learning system that recognized the individual in each learner and generated bespoke journeys in learning coping with every passion or strength of each child. Envision classrooms in which technology was so deeply intertwined with technology, rendering this space, where real-time feedback and customized pathways were feasible. Picture curriculum accounts provided by students showcasing emotional and ethical development at par with academic successes, thus showing individuals holding an education that is not only experienced but compassionate, critical of thought, and problem-solving.&#x20;

The transformation envisioned here demands a paradigm shift in people's perception of education from sedimentary, one-dimensional to vibrant, multi-dimensional journeys of growth and discovery. In this way, it will be possible to establish an education system that really tries to maximize the potential of each student by embracing the tools of the digital age and fostering a culture of continuous improvement. This new model will not only prepare them for the challenges of the modern world but also empower them to shape the future with confidence and creativity.&#x20;

Finally, such a model of standardized education is doing a disservice to what the youth are able to do. It is a relic that must be dismantled and reimagined. It is only then that one will have an educational environment that nourishes the whole person, respects his or her uniqueness, and utilizes the full spectrum of modern tools available to make learning more effective. Much of the future of education depends on how much change and innovation we are willing to undergo in the preparation of a system as dynamic and diverse as the pupils it serves.

### The Fix: Philosophy & Basis

If we are going to breathe life back into our education system, we must rebalance it towards the development of the whole person. After all, education is more than simply a matter of knowledge transmission; it is a process of cultivating human potential. Humanity needs to create a system built upon species-focused compassion, this can be done maximizing the number of the most useful outputs from the memetic repository, gauged by their enduring relevance—the "half-life" of knowledge. There needs to be a world where the system of education is not there to only teach facts but also to raise balanced, mindful, and emotionally intelligent people so as to thrive amid constant change.

From birth to eighteen, the human brain is a sponge—absorbing and synthesizing information at higher levels than any other time. If this period of potential demands anything at all, it is a high-stimulus environment that will satisfy the curiosity and classic energy surge of youth. This idea of a level-based system builds upon these formative years by surrounding students with a rich tapestry of stimuli. There would be a classroom in which the act of learning itself serves as an adventure—a journey through the wonders of science, the beauty of the arts, and complexities of human relationships. It engages but also challenges them to see how far they can stretch their understanding and imagination.

The memetic repository learn cycle should be developing in all directions simultaneously. It shouldn't be temporal topics but a holistic experience—intellectual, emotional, and social maturation interwoven into one. It is an ecosystem in which mathematics flows into music, history raises questions of ethics, and scientific inquiry prompts philosophical debate. It is this interdisciplinary approach that ensures that students are not just mere recipients of facts but dynamic participants in a learning process in which they become highly adaptive and creative problem solvers who have the ability and flexibility to navigate in today's world.

Every child should be granted an educational experience that is as individual as they are. While 1:1 tutoring may not be necessary or required at every stage, it serves as a great asset when that level of personalized instruction can make all the difference. Then there are the AI tutors—brilliant, adaptive coaches, learning with the student. These AI tutors are never tired of keeping an eye on every child, observing their style of learning, abilities, and weaknesses. They give feedback that is modified to suit each child's needs so that each lesson would be unique. It will be a time when a child isn't crawling through class but facing ahead with an AI tutor who cultivates his curiosity and passion for learning as if naturally built-in.&#x20;

AI tutors, credible and revolutionary in personalized education, make a learning experience smoother, playfully educational, and extremely effective by continuously adjusting to the unique needs of each child. They provide real-time feedback, adapt the teaching strategy as required, and personalize the learning process like no traditional method ever could. Computerized tutors of knowledge will help your child not only master algebra but also inspire _enthusiasm_ for mathematics and not just teach history, but inculcate _respect_ for lessons from the past. This tailored, adaptive approach changes learning from homework to a journey of wonder.

Education does not exist in a vacuum but is a collaborative effort between parents, schools, and the community.

In this vision, this is a seamless and symbiotic partnership. Advanced communication tools and shared educational platforms make sure parents and educators are always on the same page in working together for the growth of the child. There will be an ability to track the child's progress in real time—to see their triumphs and struggles and work with their teachers on approaches to secure success.

The joint effort—compassionate and mutually respectful in nature—furthers a positive learning environment that reinforces the well-being of the whole person.

Compassion is intrinsic to our model of learning. It is not just about raising knowledgeable beings but also healthy, happy, and perfectly adjusted members of society. Compassion breeds coordination in all stakeholders: teachers, parents, and AI-powered tutors working together to accomplish a common objective. This is a system of education where every decision is taken by considering the welfare of a child, guided by compassion for setting curricula, teaching methodologies, and assessment strategies.

This compassionate approach is what will ensure that education is nurturing and an enriching experience that prepares students for tackling life's challenges and seizing opportunities. It is a philosophy oriented toward the development of the whole person that schooling needs for its future.

We are able to radicalize education by maximizing the most useful outputs from this memetic repository, fostering and maintaining a highly stimulating learning environment, advancing this memetic repository learn cycle by using AI to facilitate personalized tutoring, and coordinating these efforts with parents' schools through compassionate foundering propositions that will give each child all that is necessary for his or her proper growth in life. Every child is bound to do well in a system that celebrates individuality, creativity, and lays the ground for their future replete with all possibilities. It is what ACEL schools offer: an education not so much about learning as much as becoming the best version of oneself.

### Why Parents Will Choose the School of ACEL

In the rapidly evolving sector of education, parents determine which educational models will thrive and which will be left to fade away. At the core of the ACEL School lies an appreciation for the parents' expectations and students' needs, with a scope of innovative yet practical learning for transformation. Here is why parents will choose the ACCEL School as the ideal environment for the education of their children:

Perhaps one of the most compelling reasons parents will be attracted to the ACEL School is the affordability of education. By further leveraging AI to truly systematize and automate administrative tasks, personalize learning, and lower overhead costs, ACEL Schools could provide high-quality education at a lower cost. This price point accessibility gives more families the opportunity to give their children an exceptional educational experience without experiencing excessive tuition fees. The use of AI not only reduces costs but also enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of the educational process, allowing for more resources to be directed towards enriching the student experience.

The ACEL School is designed to adapt to each child's individual pace of learning, offering a reflexive model that can move as rapidly or deliberately as the student and family desire. It is precisely this flexibility of the ACEL School toward meeting each child's individual needs that will enable parents to tailor their children's education, so neither boredom nor overwhelm sets in. Whether a child is accelerated in any particular subject or more time is needed to develop mastery, it is this tailored learning approach which respects and nourishes in individual development.

At the heart of ACEL School's philosophy is a holistic approach to education--one that definitely goes beyond traditional subjects. Tapping into a comprehensive memetic repository, the ACEL Schools are able to offer a curriculum that places much-needed attention on the development of the whole person: fostering emotional intelligence, critical thinking, and creativity with academic skills. Further, the school's commitment to tending to natural gifts and developed interests contributes toward all round education that will help them in personal and professional life.

Unlike traditional schools, where the curriculum really is a mandate from the state, ACEL School provides an incredibly open education. Parents can "toggle" different aspects of the curriculum to align with family values and their child's interests. Such high customizability enables parents to take an active role in their children's education, ensuring that the schooling reflects their cultural, ethical, and intellectual priorities. In addition, this adaptability of the design means that the ACEL School will be able to handle changes in priority regarding education or any new technological development very quickly, so that the learning experience always remains relevant and engaging.&#x20;

Other alternative schooling models, like Montessori schools, have already proved that, in fact, there is space for the formation of new educational systems that would give a totally different approach than the traditional one. ACEL Schools deepen this foundation through the incorporation of advanced technologies and unique personalized learning approaches that answer students' diverse needs today.\
Knowing that alternative models have been effective, parents will feel much more confident about the ability of the ACEL School to handle their child; it will be more than an experiment, but a realistic, helpful option.\
\
Ultimately, parents will opt for ACEL School because it gives an adaptable, efficient, and empowering education. ACEL Schools put family needs and preferences at the forefront, binding educators and parents together for the best service of interest to their student. This kind of collaborative approach makes education a journey, respecting parental insight and aspiration while equipping learners with tools and support to create successful lives.

In summary, ACEL School is among the most alluring possibilities for parents seeking good, cheap, flexible, and effective education. Viewed across a broader front of embracing innovation and personalization, the ACEL School gives an environment that enriches learning while respecting the diversified needs and values among families in the preparation of students for their future. In a changing educational landscape, it is only within the ACEL School that one finds a model which will succeed in the marketplace of ideas and possibilities.

### ACEL: Understanding its Memetic-Self

Naturally, these questions of religion are posited in excited consideration of the opportunity to frame ACEL, while it's still in its youth, as a _something_ — that is, to methodologically situate it in a recognizable, digestible, adoptable format. As one of the causes for its inception was _palatability_, its framework must obviously be just that; and, for something to be palatable, it must be, to some extent, _familiar_. In other words, people must be able to recognize _what ACEL is_ immediately upon their introduction with its words. There should be no ambiguity as to whether it is, or whether it understands itself as, a philosophy, a social activist movement, a belief system, etc. That there has been given no basis yet for any claim in this regard, we must engage in a process of discovery.&#x20;

In other words, the youthful ACEL must perform a thorough and public self-audit of its stock, its assets and liabilities; before it arrives to the stage and present public invitation, it needs to know if it can claim resonance with some historical mirror, so that it might learn from those memetically aligned structures and effectuate more change than otherwise by knowing itself more precisely. Emile Durkheim says of this in terms of "society", in _The Elementary Forms of Religious Life,_ "A society is not constituted simply by the mass of individuals who comprise it, the ground they occupy, the things they use, or the movements they make, but above all by the idea it has of itself" (425).  For, while _it_ might know where it's going, the simple fact is, interested persons must also know where _they_ are going should they decide to accept the invitation. Therefore, once we perform an open-air self-identification using a bottom-up methodology — i.e. there is no predetermined conclusion about what the final result will be — once we have laid out all of what ACEL is and is not, what it has to offer and what it does not, then it may line up its assets and liabilities and consider with which memetic framework might be best for it to self-identify, and if it is indeed worthy of a long fruitful half-life. We might again apply Durkheim's thinking of society to ACEL here, in that, if, from this audit, ACEL, "... is to be able to become conscious of itself and keep the sense it has of itself at the required intensity, it must assemble and concentrate. This concentration brings about an uplifting of moral life that is expressed by a set of ideal conceptions in which the new life thus awakened is depicted" (425).

### Acknowledging the Tricky Part First

Before beginning this self-audit, we must first, as adult readers, recognize that ACEL, despite having the structural legs of a tried and tested memetic powerhouse, is still in its early adolescence; it is full of intensity and potential, and it may not yet know itself to the full extent of, say, a mature philosophy. Patience and empathy are required with it; and, easily done by recollecting one's bygone teenage years, we might encourage ACEL to be deliberate in the steps it takes while carving out its own memetic path.&#x20;

This heeding is not a deceleration but a calling attention to focus; for, with so much buzzing intensity, all that charged, world-improving potential it can barely contain inside itself, it is imperative that ACEL not waste or dissipate itself with a lack of focus. It has too much to offer; and therefore it must put effort in ensuring that its energies are channeled, not frenetic; its aim sharpened, not erratic. If it can maintain these qualities through its launch into the memetic marketplace, then it stands to truly live the full extent of its half-life potential.

The reasoning behind this parental finger-wag is that ACEL, as has been shown, may wish to model itself after the Meme Infallible. By its whole nature, this would make sense: Why wouldn't ACEL aim to model itself on the longest half-life, the strongest, most infallible memetic structure that is Religion? In and of itself, this is no issue; however, historical context tells us differently, that in fact there is very tricky territory to navigate here, as historical precedent has shown us the following: that those thought systems who have previously attempted to mime the Meme Infallible, that is, Religion, quickly and inevitably fall into the pit of "cults". This is _not_ where we want ACEL, nor any memetic structure with such enormous potentiality to end up; it is not where ACEL _should_ wind up.&#x20;

Thus, the reasoning for the bottom-up self-audit. Does ACEL, in fact, have what it takes to fly over the "pit of cults" and successfully _mime the unmemeable_? Only the self-audit can say. Regardless of the outcome, a guiding question of this exercise might ask the following: If there were a way, what would it look like for any full-of-promising memetic structure go about applying what _is possible_ of the memetic strengths of Religion, _without_ ever claiming to be one, or _without_ ever being mistaken as an attempt to be one? Without further ado.&#x20;

### ACEL's Self-Audit&#x20;

This exercise aims to present the public with an open-air self-audit of ACEL's "Assets & Liabilities". The purpose behind this voluntary showing of strengths and areas for improvement is to model an organic and earnest pursuit to find the optimal memetic framework in which to propose situating ACEL. It should be reiterated here just before beginning that this is being performed via a bottom-up and first principles methodologies, that there is no prior knowledge or motive of where ACEL "ought to" belong prior to start. Any parallelisms are by pure providence. Let's begin.&#x20;

(Note: As they are explained in depth elsewhere, Assets & Liabilities noted below will be explained only briefly.)

#### Assets&#x20;

* **Clearly Defined Purpose**&#x20;
  * To secure and ensure that the evolution of humanity is seen through to its full completion.&#x20;
  * Of its own volition, ACEL created this its _raison d'etre_, and throughout itself retains focus on this foundational, frequently-referenced imperative. In fact, ACEL presents itself as being worthy of existence _only_ for this reason; it does not exist without this anchor. This purpose has easy buy-in and can, from a high level, be propagated easily.&#x20;
* **Complete Metaphysical Picture**&#x20;
  * Grand Design: Biological Machines -> Silicon Machines -> Energy Machines -> Universal Machine (-> back to beginning?)
  * ACEL, despite its youth, has a full and complete metaphysical picture informed by historical biology, economic theory, quantum theory, process theory, religious studies, contemporary theory in the social sciences. This includes but is not limited to: a thorough attendance to the physical nature of reality and a consideration of our insignificance; an ultimate reason for our existence and the universe as well as its antithesis; a philosophical attendance to Time, Space, Reality, & Relationality.
* **Praxis-Based Methodology**
  * accelerate human intelligence -> maximize human agency -> complete humanity's evolutionary cycle
  * ACEL posits many various, yet all essential, actionable approaches aligned with its purpose. Methods are heavily variegated. A small sample: implementation of Mises-based free-market capitalism in all realms of exchange; maintain peace at all costs with Biological-Silicon Machines; intentionality in genetic and memetic reproduction; initiate alternative schooling system; begin at-scale space exploration.
* **Clear Moral Guidelines**
  * "If the action accelerates human intelligence & improve the security of human evolution, according to ACEL thinking, then the action is moral."
  * ACEL proposes the this moral compass to guide our behaviors. Simple, direct, and utilitarian in nature, it emphasizes individual potential and the development of one's agency. Guidelines maintain emphasis on importance of raising children: As they are more capable to possess a wider repository of genes and memes, we are only to guide them, ever-attentive to the fact that they have an innate potential to exceed our capabilities. Guidelines exists outside the bounds of traditional religious morality or new State morality. There is no exclusionary ideology against any group except the Decels.
* **Temporally Situated with Origin Story**&#x20;
  * We are nearing a point where we must make Existential Leap, a significant turning point in the course of the universe's memetic knowledge.&#x20;
  * ACEL bestows upon humanity a substantial significance in the past, present, and future of the universe. We are important agents and have a role to play in the unfolding of all things.
* **Tone of Optimism**
  * ACEL embodies an optimism in outlook via an unwavering confidence deeply set in its system, that we are in fact capable of achieving the goal set out for us. We can actually fulfill our purpose. &#x20;
* **Clearly Defined Enemy**
  * Borrowed from e/acc thinking, ACEL has a well-defined abstract enemy, Decelerants (i.e. Decels), which serve as a clear framework for rejection.&#x20;

#### Liabilities

* **Methodological Scope**&#x20;
  * ACEL is voraciously determined to accelerate human intelligence and by simple virtue of its name it makes sense to see such a sweeping, full frontal approach to altering every facet of life simultaneously. Certainly, this is no game for ACEL. With that said, without adoption at scale, the sheer _amount_ of plans ACEL has may pose a risk to the _potency_ of its plans. It should not let loose from the gas; rather, it should become more detailed and precision-driven in each of its actionable tasks, perhaps even down to the year. It is that type of accelerant sharpness that could lead to more effectively executed intentions.    &#x20;
* **Potential Misunderstandings/Misinterpretation**
  * There is a fairly high likelihood ACEL will be herded in with other groups of Accelerationism, at least at first. This poses a "guilty-by-association" risk to success, based on the history of Accelerationism's public image and those violent sects who've misguidedly taken the name. ACEL will need to frequently reiterate through public discourse that it actively plots an entirely different course than all other groups who've preceded it, even e/acc. It should recount that the only two items in common are the name, and the priority of "output".&#x20;
* **Practicality**
  * Time will tell, but some of the actionable tasks on ACEL's To-Do List are unprecedented in their boldness. While it should not alter its plans on this behalf, it only should acknowledge and be ready for its public image to be tested and cast in certain lights on behalf of these daring and brazen proposals.&#x20;

### Conclusion of Self-Audit

Taken altogether, it appears that ACEL steers clear of the dangers of being labeled a religion, or worse, an attempt at a religion. ACEL lacks many of the components integral to religion par excellence: modes of the supernatural, forms of worship, requisite dogmatic creeds, deities, foundational literature, etc. Missing one or two of these, ACEL might be able to still pass itself off as some semblance of a religious group, but it is clearly differentiated enough to state that ACEL is _not_ a religion. With that said, one aspect of religion it does retain, as it was stated in the prologue, is _faith_, but a faith secularized, whose nexus extends no farther than a confidence that certain actions beget certain outcomes. In this way, ACEL holds a space open for belief _without_ asking for any metaphysical buy-in; rather, it asks only that you consider the possibility that _certain_ _actions have certain consequences_ -- in a word, it asks you to believe in molecular biology_._

In this way, ACEL may still enjoy a long and healthy half-life; for, as a coherent framework with a clearly stated purpose and other guiding systems, it is certainly _something_. And here we might extend that question: what _is_ ACEL, exactly?&#x20;

To answer this, it's best to look to the past for historical precedent. Doing so shows that ACEL carries _two_ defining attributes that bring it in commonality with similar past manifestations, and so encourage a precise and withstanding classification: First, that its interests span such a wide range of sectors — i.e. economics, technology, politics, evolution, culture, physics, psychology, automation, etc. — it may be understood as _holistic_ in nature. Second, that ACEL grounds itself in intentional praxis directed towards some cultural change (much as, say, the Enlightenment movement intended to bring reason and logic into sectors of culture and society), it falls within the scope of _cultural movements_. Taken together, these defining features encourage a classification of ACEL as that of an _holistic cultural movement_.

Thus we have a framing by which ACEL may confidently move into and through the world, one whose backdrop it shares with the refined aesthetic of the Renaissance, the emotional vibrancy of Romanticism, the charged power of the Civil Rights Movement, and more.&#x20;

With this new self-knowledge, ACEL finds itself equipped with intelligence at both hips, ready to share its observations of humanity and its longview of agented evolution.
