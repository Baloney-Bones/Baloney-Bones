# Chapter 12: The School of ACEL

One might recall from chapter 1 the _nothing-else-matters_ value that ACEL places on the proper support and raising of children—the ensuring that all children receive prioritized, empathetic, attentive structures within which they are raised and educated. This is because ACEL's respect of, care for, and encouragement of children is the only topic in its purview that rivals 'the survival and evolution of humanity' in importance. When placed adjacent, is it not clear why? Are _children_ and _the survival and evolution of humanity_ _not_ in fact one and the same? Is it not the case that children are in fact, those next in line to take ownership of their own humanity? of those who will _receive_ _our_ humanity? Such is the reason for the placement of _parenting_ in the very front of the this book.

### A Broken Education Model

And a Brief Tirade About It&#x20;

And yet, the public school system write large—those organizations who require their employees by law on paper to legally claim themselves as _in loco parentis—_utterly fail to provide any sort of the thing that resembles a parent, and thereby pathetically fail the movers of our future. Save a few nations, e.g., Singapore, Finland, and Japan—systems of the U.S. and their embodied extensions, that is, administrators, make excuses—much like the poorly raised children they themselves claim to be raising in the classroom—for their failure to appropriately carry out perhaps the singular most important role on planet Earth (outside of being their actual parent); this is, with finality, embarrassing to humanity, to the human species. It is within these buildings—for, they are not worth being reified as a school; shelter appears to be all they are good for—that is visibly shown, primarily to these young people (who are much more perceptive than they are given due), how much they _don't_ matter, when their bureaucratic prioritize appeasing the union that bullies it and continuing to employ disgraces who call themselves teachers. It is such an utter comprehensive failure on human integrity, and who is to tell these children that it's not their fault? that they are worth teaching well?&#x20;

While this is a sweeping and affective tirade, it of course knows there are many big-hearted, effective-teaching saints walking who are and will always be heroes to their students, and they know who they are; ACEL speaks mainly of the administrators and the feet-on-desk "tenured" teachers, who also know who they are.&#x20;

Here the vent ends and precise zones of issue in public schools will be listed and examined, after which solutions will be proposed.

#### Zones of Issues

1.  **Standardization Models Reify Nothing**

    Standardization is education-speak for Centralization; it is a centralizing system of alignment. It might be no surprise that the Standardized Test is built off none other than the World War I Army Alpha Test, to screen and place American soldiers in combat depending on their IQ.  Because it was a test distributable to masses of troops, it introduced a scalable model of testing. So, we trade meaningful assessment for literally meaningless convenience—our 5th graders are not being placed for the infantry in the Battle of the Somme. While a hyperbolic sarcasm, there is nothing to laugh about ranking 38th in Mathematics, currently where the United States sits. To sum up, we oughtn't give army tests to middle schoolers.&#x20;

    **Recommendation: Get Rid of the Standardized Test**

    Finally, such a model of standardized education is doing a disservice to what the youth are able to do. It is a relic that must be dismantled and reimagined. It is only then that one will have an educational environment that nourishes the whole person, respects his or her uniqueness, and utilizes the full spectrum of modern tools available to make learning more effective. Much of the future of education depends on how much change and innovation we are willing to undergo in the preparation of a system as dynamic and diverse as the pupils it serves.
2.  **No Accounting for Individuality in Studies**

    While perhaps sweeping, by and large, if a parent wants their child to be understood regarded as a "whole person", with conflicting interests that come and go and the school accommodates and individualizes their studies—they are going to have to pay handsomely for that. For, the sad truth is, public schools either don't have the bandwidth due to overcrowded schools, or they do not have the quality educators that will open these spaces to students; or both. Private schools whose tuition costs $30k/year and class sizes of 12:1; those are where the "whole student" is considered. It is a shame; all children deserve this model of learning, for it absolutely is effective. &#x20;

    **Recommendation: Support Individuality**

    One would think from first principles this is a given—far from it. And really, a major piece holding this particular struggle back is not the system itself, directly; it is teachers unwillingness to accommodate student needs. This is all the more reason that the autonomy of the teacher's union must be sized back. In this way, for example, a "set-in-his-ways" teacher who assigns reading homework in a book, and refuses to allow a student asking to read it in an OCR pdf that accommodates her diagnosed severe dyslexia. She tries to read the book and can't; she fails her quiz. The next day he makes fun of her in front of the class saying, "I guess paper turns the words upside down, huh?" Naturally, as this will not be his first transgression; glory be, he will be fired. There are excellent, empathetic, and eager teachers out there seeking jobs. Set the memes free.
3.  **Outdated Curriculum**

    While the Common Core Standards was updated in 2010, the majority of the public school curriculum is a residual skeleton of the early to mid-1800s. While there have been improvements over time; they are far from perfect and still are incapable of addressing the individualized needs of each student.&#x20;

    **Recommendation: Active Learning Models/Best Practices:**&#x20;

    Emergent in private schools but as yet still largely absent in public school, the pedagogical shift from sedentary, rote, one-dimensional to vibrant, high-impact, multi-disciplinary journeys of growth and discovery. In this way, it will be possible to establish an education system that really tries to maximize the potential of each student by embracing the tools of the digital age and fostering a culture of continuous improvement. This new model will not only prepare them for the challenges of the modern world but also empower them to shape the future with confidence and creativity.&#x20;
4.  **No Technology**

    While possibly an issue with funding, the amount of issues regarding public school funding are too much complex and far too corrupt for the scope of this chapter. Suffice it to say, if a school doesn't have public computers for students to use, look at the salaries of the tenured teachers reading the newspaper during class time.

    **Petition Respective State to Pass Right-to-Work Laws**

    Doing so will destabilize the financial revenue of over-powerful teacher's unions, insofar as these will not be able to require employees to pay dues regardless of if you are a members. Ineffective teachers should not be employed as teachers; that is an absolutely asinine, and visible motive of these hegemonic unions. Bust them up. This will open up capital for things like computers, and more competitive salaries for deserving teachers. &#x20;

### The Fix: Philosophy & Basis of The ACEL School

Below are core values and principles of The ACEL School, separated into two distinct lists. Note: While there are some parallels between the above recommendations for public school systems and the core values and principles below,&#x20;

&#x20;In the school spirit of things, we will do lists again:

#### Philosophy

1. The memetic repository learn cycle should be a contextual, holistic enterprise developing in all directions simultaneously. For ex. mathematics flows into music, history raises questions of ethics, and scientific inquiry prompts philosophical debate.
2. The ACEL School cultivates individual human potential by focusing on the development of the _whole person_.&#x20;
3. This focus takes as its ground a compassion for all humanity, all agencies. this can be done maximizing the number of the most useful outputs from the memetic repository, gauged by their enduring relevance—the "half-life" of knowledge.&#x20;
4. raise balanced, mindful, and emotionally intelligent people so as to thrive amid constant change.

### Basis



1. The school would use AI-enhanced delivery systems in a high-stimulation environment and the delivery would be 1-1.
2. The child would enter the system every day, and be guided on a rotating field of education. The bouts of delivery would be short; 20 mins of high-stimulation delivery, 10 mins of testing, then move on. A fast rotation of subject matter would ensure the child stays engaged and doesn’t drop off in focus.&#x20;
   * Fast and immediate testing serves two purposes; one to train the uptake of the information, and the second to pulse-check the progress of the child’s uptake. This would allow extremely personalised content delivery at the rate the child has demonstrated to operate at
3. Every child receives 1:1 instruction.  While 1:1 tutoring may not be necessary or required at every stage, it serves as a great asset when that level of personalized instruction can make all the difference.&#x20;
4. Then there are the AI tutors—brilliant, adaptive coaches, learning with the student. These AI tutors are never tired of keeping an eye on every child, observing their style of learning, abilities, and weaknesses. They give feedback that is modified to suit each child's needs so that each lesson would be unique.&#x20;
5. Individualized & Customizable&#x20;
   1. AI tutors, credible and revolutionary in personalized education, make a learning experience smoother, playfully educational, and extremely effective by continuously adjusting to the unique needs of each child. They provide real-time feedback, adapt the teaching strategy as required, and personalize the learning process like no traditional method ever could. Computerized tutors of knowledge will help your child not only master algebra but also inspire _enthusiasm_ for mathematics and not just teach history, but inculcate _respect_ for lessons from the past. This tailored, adaptive approach changes learning from homework to a journey of wonder.
6. Level-Based System:
   1. From birth to eighteen, the human brain is a sponge—absorbing and synthesizing information at higher levels than any other time. If this period of potential demands anything at all, it is a high-stimulus environment that will satisfy the curiosity and classic energy surge of youth. This idea of a level-based system builds upon these formative years by surrounding students with a rich tapestry of stimuli. There would be a classroom in which the act of learning itself serves as an adventure—a journey through the wonders of science, the beauty of the arts, and complexities of human relationships. It engages but also challenges them to see how far they can stretch their understanding and imagination.

### Why Parents Will Choose the School of ACEL

In its rapidly evolving sector of education, parents determine which educational models will thrive and which will be left to fade away. At the core of the ACEL School lies an appreciation for the parents' expectations and students' needs, with a scope of innovative yet practical learning for transformation. Here is why parents will choose the ACCEL School as the ideal environment for the education of their children:

We are able to radicalize education by maximizing the most useful outputs from this memetic repository, fostering and maintaining a highly stimulating learning environment, advancing this memetic repository learn cycle by using AI to facilitate personalized tutoring, and coordinating these efforts with parents' schools through compassionate foundering propositions that will give each child all that is necessary for his or her proper growth in life. Every child is bound to do well in a system that celebrates individuality, creativity, and lays the ground for their future replete with all possibilities. It is what ACEL schools offer: an education not so much about learning as much as becoming the best version of oneself.

Education does not exist in a vacuum but is a collaborative effort between parents, schools, and the community. In this vision, this is a seamless and symbiotic partnership. Advanced communication tools and shared educational platforms make sure parents and educators are always on the same page in working together for the growth of the child. There will be an ability to track the child's progress in real time—to see their triumphs and struggles and work with their teachers on approaches to secure success. The joint effort—compassionate and mutually respectful in nature—furthers a positive learning environment that reinforces the well-being of the whole person.

Perhaps one of the most compelling reasons parents will be attracted to the ACEL School is the affordability of education. By further leveraging AI to truly systematize and automate administrative tasks, personalize learning, and lower overhead costs, ACEL Schools could provide high-quality education at a lower cost. This price point accessibility gives more families the opportunity to give their children an exceptional educational experience without experiencing excessive tuition fees. The use of AI not only reduces costs but also enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of the educational process, allowing for more resources to be directed towards enriching the student experience.

The ACEL School is designed to adapt to each child's individual pace of learning, offering a reflexive model that can move as rapidly or deliberately as the student and family desire. It is precisely this flexibility of the ACEL School toward meeting each child's individual needs that will enable parents to tailor their children's education, so neither boredom nor overwhelm sets in. Whether a child is accelerated in any particular subject or more time is needed to develop mastery, it is this tailored learning approach which respects and nourishes in individual development.

Compassion is intrinsic to our model of learning. It is not just about raising knowledgeable beings but also healthy, happy, and perfectly adjusted members of society. Compassion breeds coordination in all stakeholders: teachers, parents, and AI-powered tutors working together to accomplish a common objective. This is a system of education where every decision is taken by considering the welfare of a child, guided by compassion for setting curricula, teaching methodologies, and assessment strategies.This compassionate approach is what will ensure that education is nurturing and an enriching experience that prepares students for tackling life's challenges and seizing opportunities. It is a philosophy oriented toward the development of the whole person that schooling needs for its future.

At the heart of ACEL School's philosophy is a holistic approach to education--one that definitely goes beyond traditional subjects. Tapping into a comprehensive memetic repository, the ACEL Schools are able to offer a curriculum that places much-needed attention on the development of the whole person: fostering emotional intelligence, critical thinking, and creativity with academic skills. Further, the school's commitment to tending to natural gifts and developed interests contributes toward all round education that will help them in personal and professional life.

Unlike traditional schools, where the curriculum really is a mandate from the state, ACEL School provides an incredibly open education. Parents can "toggle" different aspects of the curriculum to align with family values and their child's interests. Such high customizability enables parents to take an active role in their children's education, ensuring that the schooling reflects their cultural, ethical, and intellectual priorities. In addition, this adaptability of the design means that the ACEL School will be able to handle changes in priority regarding education or any new technological development very quickly, so that the learning experience always remains relevant and engaging.&#x20;

Other alternative schooling models, like Montessori schools, have already proved that, in fact, there is space for the formation of new educational systems that would give a totally different approach than the traditional one. ACEL Schools deepen this foundation through the incorporation of advanced technologies and unique personalized learning approaches that answer students' diverse needs today.\
Knowing that alternative models have been effective, parents will feel much more confident about the ability of the ACEL School to handle their child; it will be more than an experiment, but a realistic, helpful option.\
\
Ultimately, parents will opt for ACEL School because it gives an adaptable, efficient, and empowering education. ACEL Schools put family needs and preferences at the forefront, binding educators and parents together for the best service of interest to their student. This kind of collaborative approach makes education a journey, respecting parental insight and aspiration while equipping learners with tools and support to create successful lives.

In summary, ACEL School is among the most alluring possibilities for parents seeking good, cheap, flexible, and effective education. Viewed across a broader front of embracing innovation and personalization, the ACEL School gives an environment that enriches learning while respecting the diversified needs and values among families in the preparation of students for their future. In a changing educational landscape, it is only within the ACEL School that one finds a model which will succeed in the marketplace of ideas and possibilities.

### ACEL's 'Self-Progress Report' to Parents

Much like in PTO Meetings, where a teacher and parent(s) might review their child's general approach to school (e.g. always bright and engaged, shy around others, etc.), more attuned notes in class (e.g. participates, falls asleep, etc.), participation level and so forth, always the most prevalent topic is some sort of progress report of the student's academic strengths and weakness. Here we turn this around and give ACEL its own "Self-Progress Report"; and, though not academic, if schools assess student's in this way, why are we not assessed in some similar manner, as well? We think prospective parents who might find some initial resonance with ACEL's educational model ought to see what ACEL thinks about itself, and may appreciate its honest self-review. This will be a process of self-discovery, for ACEL, as well.

We believe this should be done before it arrives to the stage and presents public invitation. The ACEL School is genuinely curious of public interest in this program; if you are interested, please do reach out. This is all done in the name of the potential benefit of kids being in a space that is highly engaging, challenging to their level, specified, at so on. It is all about whether or not your child would feel most comfortable in this type of educational setting, and thus be able to truly engage with it and activate intelligence by it; for, at the end of the day, it is not about us, it is about the student. As such, we'll perform an open-air self-profress report using a bottom-up methodology—i.e. there is no predetermined conclusion about what the final result will be—once we have laid out all of what ACEL _is_ and _is_ _not_, what it has to offer and what it does not, then it may line up its assets and liabilities and consider with which memetic framework might be best for it to self-identify, and if it is indeed worthy of a long fruitful half-life.&#x20;

### Acknowledging the Tricky Part First

Before beginning this self-audit, we must first, as adult readers, recognize that ACEL, despite having the structural legs of a tried and tested memetic powerhouse, is still in its early adolescence; it is full of intensity and potential, and it may not yet know itself to the full extent of, say, its mature educational  philosophy. Patience and empathy are required with it; and, easily done by recollecting one's bygone teenage years, we might encourage ACEL to be deliberate in the steps it takes while carving out its own schooling path. For it, not you, is what matters. &#x20;

This heeding is not a deceleration but a calling attention to focus; for, with so much buzzing intensity, all that charged, world-improving potential it can barely contain inside itself, it is imperative that ACEL not waste or dissipate itself with a lack of focus. It has too much to offer; and therefore it must put effort in ensuring that its energies are channeled, not frenetic; its aim sharpened, not erratic. If it can maintain these qualities through its launch into the memetic marketplace, then it stands to truly live the full extent of its half-life potential.

The reasoning behind this parental finger-wag is that ACEL, as has been shown, may wish to model itself after the Meme Infallible. By its whole nature, this would make sense: Why wouldn't ACEL aim to model itself on the longest half-life, the strongest, most infallible memetic structure that is Religion? In and of itself, this is no issue; however, historical context tells us differently, that in fact there is very tricky territory to navigate here, as historical precedent has shown us the following: that those thought systems who have previously attempted to mime the Meme Infallible, that is, Religion, quickly and inevitably fall into the pit of "cults". This is _not_ where we want ACEL, nor any memetic structure with such enormous potentiality to end up; it is not where ACEL _should_ wind up.&#x20;

Thus, the reasoning for the bottom-up self-audit. Does ACEL, in fact, have what it takes to fly over the "pit of cults" and successfully _mime the unmemeable_? Only the self-audit can say. Regardless of the outcome, a guiding question of this exercise might ask the following: If there were a way, what would it look like for any full-of-promising memetic structure go about applying what _is possible_ of the memetic strengths of Religion, _without_ ever claiming to be one, or _without_ ever being mistaken as an attempt to be one? Without further ado.&#x20;

### ACEL's Self-Audit&#x20;

This exercise aims to present the public with an open-air self-audit of ACEL's "Assets & Liabilities". The purpose behind this voluntary showing of strengths and areas for improvement is to model an organic and earnest pursuit to find the optimal memetic framework in which to propose situating ACEL. It should be reiterated here just before beginning that this is being performed via a bottom-up and first principles methodologies, that there is no prior knowledge or motive of where ACEL "ought to" belong prior to start. Any parallelisms are by pure providence. Let's begin.&#x20;

(Note: As they are explained in depth elsewhere, Assets & Liabilities noted below will be explained only briefly.)

#### Assets&#x20;

* **Clearly Defined Purpose**&#x20;
  * To secure and ensure that the evolution of humanity is seen through to its full completion.&#x20;
  * Of its own volition, ACEL created this its _raison d'etre_, and throughout itself retains focus on this foundational, frequently-referenced imperative. In fact, ACEL presents itself as being worthy of existence _only_ for this reason; it does not exist without this anchor. This purpose has easy buy-in and can, from a high level, be propagated easily.&#x20;
* **Complete Metaphysical Picture**&#x20;
  * Grand Design: Biological Machines -> Silicon Machines -> Energy Machines -> Universal Machine (-> back to beginning?)
  * ACEL, despite its youth, has a full and complete metaphysical picture informed by historical biology, economic theory, quantum theory, process theory, religious studies, contemporary theory in the social sciences. This includes but is not limited to: a thorough attendance to the physical nature of reality and a consideration of our insignificance; an ultimate reason for our existence and the universe as well as its antithesis; a philosophical attendance to Time, Space, Reality, & Relationality.
* **Praxis-Based Methodology**
  * accelerate human intelligence -> maximize human agency -> complete humanity's evolutionary cycle
  * ACEL posits many various, yet all essential, actionable approaches aligned with its purpose. Methods are heavily variegated. A small sample: implementation of Mises-based free-market capitalism in all realms of exchange; maintain peace at all costs with Biological-Silicon Machines; intentionality in genetic and memetic reproduction; initiate alternative schooling system; begin at-scale space exploration.
* **Clear Moral Guidelines**
  * "If the action accelerates human intelligence & improve the security of human evolution, according to ACEL thinking, then the action is moral."
  * ACEL proposes the this moral compass to guide our behaviors. Simple, direct, and utilitarian in nature, it emphasizes individual potential and the development of one's agency. Guidelines maintain emphasis on importance of raising children: As they are more capable to possess a wider repository of genes and memes, we are only to guide them, ever-attentive to the fact that they have an innate potential to exceed our capabilities. Guidelines exists outside the bounds of traditional religious morality or new State morality. There is no exclusionary ideology against any group except the Decels.
* **Temporally Situated with Origin Story**&#x20;
  * We are nearing a point where we must make Existential Leap, a significant turning point in the course of the universe's memetic knowledge.&#x20;
  * ACEL bestows upon humanity a substantial significance in the past, present, and future of the universe. We are important agents and have a role to play in the unfolding of all things.
* **Tone of Optimism**
  * ACEL embodies an optimism in outlook via an unwavering confidence deeply set in its system, that we are in fact capable of achieving the goal set out for us. We can actually fulfill our purpose. &#x20;

#### Liabilities

* **Methodological Scope**&#x20;
  * ACEL is voraciously determined to accelerate human intelligence and by simple virtue of its name it makes sense to see such a sweeping, full frontal approach to altering every facet of life simultaneously. Certainly, this is no game for ACEL. With that said, without adoption at scale, the sheer _amount_ of plans ACEL has may pose a risk to the _potency_ of its plans. It should not let loose from the gas; rather, it should become more detailed and precision-driven in each of its actionable tasks, perhaps even down to the year. It is that type of accelerant sharpness that could lead to more effectively executed intentions.    &#x20;
* **Potential Misunderstandings/Misinterpretation**
  * There is a fairly high likelihood ACEL will be herded in with other groups of Accelerationism, at least at first. This poses a "guilty-by-association" risk to success, based on the history of Accelerationism's public image and those violent sects who've misguidedly taken the name. ACEL will need to frequently reiterate through public discourse that it actively plots an entirely different course than all other groups who've preceded it, even e/acc. It should recount that the only two items in common are the name, and the priority of "output".&#x20;
* **Practicality**
  * Time will tell, but some of the actionable tasks on ACEL's To-Do List are unprecedented in their boldness. While it should not alter its plans on this behalf, it only should acknowledge and be ready for its public image to be tested and cast in certain lights on behalf of these daring and brazen proposals.&#x20;
* **Clearly Defined Enemy**
  * Borrowed from e/acc thinking, ACEL has a well-defined abstract enemy, Decelerants (i.e. Decels), which serve as a clear framework for rejection.&#x20;

### Conclusion of Self-Audit

Taken altogether, it appears that ACEL steers clear of the dangers of being labeled a religion, or worse, an attempt at a religion. ACEL lacks many of the components integral to religion par excellence: modes of the supernatural, forms of worship, requisite dogmatic creeds, deities, foundational literature, etc. Missing one or two of these, ACEL might be able to still pass itself off as some semblance of a religious group, but it is clearly differentiated enough to state that ACEL is _not_ a religion. With that said, one aspect of religion it does retain, as it was stated in the prologue, is _faith_, but a faith secularized, whose nexus extends no farther than a confidence that certain actions beget certain outcomes. In this way, ACEL holds a space open for belief _without_ asking for any metaphysical buy-in; rather, it asks only that you consider the possibility that _certain_ _actions have certain consequences_ -- in a word, it asks you to believe in molecular biology_._

In this way, ACEL may still enjoy a long and healthy half-life; for, as a coherent framework with a clearly stated purpose and other guiding systems, it is certainly _something_. And here we might extend that question: what _is_ ACEL, exactly?&#x20;

To answer this, it's best to look to the past for historical precedent. Doing so shows that ACEL carries _two_ defining attributes that bring it in commonality with similar past manifestations, and so encourage a precise and withstanding classification: First, that its interests span such a wide range of sectors — i.e. economics, technology, politics, evolution, culture, physics, psychology, automation, etc. — it may be understood as _holistic_ in nature. Second, that ACEL grounds itself in intentional praxis directed towards some cultural change (much as, say, the Enlightenment movement intended to bring reason and logic into sectors of culture and society), it falls within the scope of _cultural movements_. Taken together, these defining features encourage a classification of ACEL as that of an _holistic cultural movement_.

Thus we have a framing by which ACEL may confidently move into and through the world, one whose backdrop it shares with the refined aesthetic of the Renaissance, the emotional vibrancy of Romanticism, the charged power of the Civil Rights Movement, and more.&#x20;

With this new self-knowledge, ACEL finds itself equipped with intelligence at both hips, ready to share its observations of humanity and its longview of agented evolution.
