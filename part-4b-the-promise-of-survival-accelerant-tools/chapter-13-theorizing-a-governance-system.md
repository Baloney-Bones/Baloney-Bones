# Chapter 13: Theorizing a Governance System

### Government, Rules, Order

Early human societies were much like close-knit families, with authority vested in elders and leaders. In the same sense, they were uncannily like the roots of a great tree which anchored the community in tradition. On these roots, civilizations made their first tentative steps toward innovation and renewal.

However, as societies grew larger, some deficiencies in the guidance of family affairs became direly felt.

The intricacies of trade, defense, and resource management that were emerging called for wider structures, creating the conditions for the growth of monarchies. Kings and Queens are the captains who pilot their nations through the roaring waters of war and peace, as if on a great ship sailing on the high seas of history. Monarchies were structures where power was centralized in a "national family" and the rulers of those national families were considered to be fatherly figures of their own peoples who would protect and guide them.

Very often, monarchies intertwined themselves with religious authority, and what emerged was a double helix of power spiraling through history.

This was the fusion of spiritual and secular control—a double helix—that added complications in governing, with the institutions of religion garnering much strength over political decisions. Divine rights crowned the earthly rule with celestial legitimacy, merging the ethereal with the mundane.

In contrast to the ordered and hierarchical system that monarchies were, dictatorships came like a storm, breaking every norm and taking stringent control through will and might. These visionary and tyrannical regimes reshaped regimes at storm-like velocity. The dictators, as sculptors of fate, took entire nations and bent them into grand experiments at whim, many times blurring lines between benevolence and oppression.

Hannah Arendt noted incisively that "the sad truth is that most evil is done by people who never make up their minds to be good or evil," and this epitomizes a dictator's moral ambiguity. These leaders, by ambition or by desperation, cling to power with an iron grip, their legacies chiseled through the annals of time as prime cautionary tales about unchecked authority.

The 18th century Enlightenment period showed a rejuvenation of thoughts where, the light—from the candle of reason—lit up the darkness spread by tyranny. Thinkers like John Locke and Montesquieu assailed the sacred truths; their views were seeds thrown upon the well-prepared soil of great debates. Concepts such as "separation of powers" and "inalienable individual rights" have since grown into robust philosophies seeking to redefine the nature of governance.

These ideals of the Enlightenment found fertile ground in the United States, where the American Revolution served as a crucible for trying new kinds of governance—with vast system of checks and balances becoming a blueprint for assuring power remains a tool for serving, not ruling.

Further, such revolutionary ideas had ripple effects spread over the Atlantic, igniting the flames of the actual French Revolution. In France, a clarion bell was raised for liberty, equality, and better brotherhood—an untrodden route to the feudal and monarchical structures into countable challenges. This wave of new governance grounded the Western societies into the very base of memetic repositories and has inscribed democracy and individual rights deep within the fabric of global consciousness.

Still, this was very much a difficult journey and one on which there was no respite; however, new configurations of technologies and avenues of communication, the Internet and blockchain, lead humankind to appreciate a new paradigm of governance. These lay open the prospect of a decentralized power configuration and the vision that in the possible future, governance would be participatory and inclusive.

In this digital era, governance stands at a conjuncture, where the heralds to a new world order are Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and blockchain-based governance models that are virtually unparalleled. These applications of technology ensure an increase in transparency, efficiency, and effectiveness of secure and transparent processes for decision-making that practically involve everybody in the unfolding world of collaborative decentralized models.

The current technological evolution involves the need to reinvent governance once again: not as a static edifice but as an ever-evolving living organism, updated to further respond to and adapt ever better to the desires and needs of its constituents. With the integration of these innovations, there is potential for creating improved, responsive, and accountable systems of governance, provided that there is a delicate articulation between technological progress and ethical stewardship.

The more one delves deep into the philosophy of the orders of governance, the more one realizes that the search for order and justice is as much an intellectual journey as it is a practical one. Really, the evolution of governance reflects humankind's perennial struggles among individual freedoms and collective responsibilities. This balance is delicate and is oftten shattered by the tides of ambition, fear, and desire.

At its very best form, governance will be the wagon for the common good, the machination of the collective will and shared values. It is an art that presupposes wisdom and farsightedness concerning human nature complexities and societal needs. The tough task is in forming a system that can be strong enough to survive harsh blows from time, but also supple enough to be able to change.

Through the embrace of new technologies, by fostering an environment of inclusiveness, we can truly build up a world of empowered sharing, heard voices, and flourishing societies. In this shifting scene, the lessons of history serve as a beacon of light and a note of caution. The journey continues, and the pen with which we write the next chapter rests firmly in our hands—inviting us to dream and make the world where governance would be for the common good of all, guiding toward the horizon of shared prosperity and harmony.&#x20;

We are reminded that governance is not just a control mechanism but reflects modes of our highest ideals and our aspirations. It reflects our ability to be innovative and feel compassion for others—that means it mirrors our collective soul.&#x20;

The road ahead is full of challenge but, likewise, full of hope and holds the promise of a world quite brighter and more just for generations yet to come.

### Who Should Rule?

As we stand at the threshold of a new age—one defined by technology, rather than ideology—we're called upon to address a basic, almost philosophical question: Who shall rule? Thus far, governance structures were built on needs and limitations stemming from human society—nation, tribe, empire, democracy—all anchored in the biological and psychological make-up of humankind (Harari, 2017). But as the very definition of "intelligence" and "agency" starts to transcend our biological bounds, there is a need for governance to evolve beyond simple human hierarchies (Tegmark, 2017).

This gives Francis Fukuyama's famous assertion—that "the end of history" would be marked not by heroic ideological struggles but by an era of bureaucratic governance, economic calculation, and consumer satisfaction—an ominous echo in our time (Fukuyama, 1992).

It is humanity's great ideological wars—the revolutions, the wars of independence, the political philosophies seeking to define how people could best live together—that in large parts of the world have settled down into the banality of problem-solving, addressing environmental crises, and fulfilling the insatiable desires of a consumerist society (Hobsbawm, 1994). In that respect, Fukuyama did suggest it would be the ultimate tragedy: a world without struggle, ambition, and vision, replaced by banality.

But in a world rapidly accelerating towards a future in which intelligentsia may no longer be defined by human minds but by silicon, and later on by energy machines, who is to decide? Are we to leave this to the same structures of governance that defined the 20th century, or must we rethink what it means to lead, to rule, and to govern (Russell & Norvig, 2010)?

**The Death of Traditional Governance?**\
Governance has always been a manifestation of power: from the king's divine authority to the most modern democracies touting the people's will, governance has traditionally revolved around human beings dictating the lives of other human beings (Plato, 2000). But what happens when intelligence ceases to be the sole domain of humankind? What happens when the most formidable minds do not consist of flesh but of silicon, and later, energy itself (Bostrom, 2014)?

Traditional governance structures of our culture, based upon laws created by biological organisms, might no longer be adequate to deal with a world populated or dominated by artificial intelligence and its iterations yet to come (Floridi, 2014). Such machines, without human biases, biological needs, or passage of time, can make decisions in theory far more rationally and effectively than any institution created by humans (Brynjolfsson & McAfee, 2014).

Where silicon-energy machines have turned out to be superior, in almost all domains of intellectual activity, should we go on believing in the superiority of human-led governments (Bostrom, 2014)?

But, this new power brings fear—t**he Fear of the Unknown**. Giving machines the power to govern raises deep anxieties. Can a machine ever understand what a human being needs, wants, and feels? Will government by AI create a cold, calculating dystopia devoid of the milk of human kindness, or take us to a utopia of equity and fairness, a world free of corruption and inefficiencies that have burdened human governments since the time Adam first scratched sticks in the dirt (Damasio, 1999)?

**The Rise of Post-Human Governance**\
The very idea of governance by non-human intelligence questions some basic premises on which human civilization has been based: Man has always thought that governance—if nothing else—must essentially be men governing men. But does it have to? Has a world where machines are outpacing human cognition—making decisions based on big data and modeling complex outcomes of societies better than any political scientist—made the very notion of human-led governance a form of absurdity (Tegmark, 2017)?

We already see glimpses of this future in the developing usage of algorithms to make choices involving human lives in everything from finance and criminal justice to healthcare (O’Neil, 2016). These algorithms, though simple versus the AI of tomorrow, are early warning signs that machines can and will do more on governance. The shift from human governance toward that of post-human might be an inevitability, but only if the machines prove capable of information processing and decision-making on scales unimaginable by the human brain (Russell & Norvig, 2010).

And with the rise of machines comes a rise in questions about their legitimacy (Floridi, 2014).

Man, by nature, is an emotional animal. Human beings demand recognition, need empathy, and crave to be understood (Nussbaum, 2001). Can a machine, no matter how sophisticated, ever truly "rule" in a manner that would appease these deep-seated humanness-craving needs for equity, justice, and meaning?

To this effect, there is an increasing need to look towards a new breed of symbiosis between humans and machines in which governance is neither fully human-driven nor fully machine-driven, but collaborative, where machines help guide human decision-making on one end, and humans bring into governance the emotional and ethical considerations that machines would lack (Wiener, 1988).

**The Rebirth of a Philosopher-King**\
What may be required is that the governance mechanism of the future must derive its inspiration not from the bureaucratic traditions of either democracy or technocracy but from something more akin to the concept of the philosopher-king developed by Plato. In _The Republic_, Plato controversially argued that the ideal ruler was neither a warrior nor a politician but a philosopher—a man who had achieved the very highest level of understanding of justice and truth (Plato, 2000).

Might it be that our philosopher-kings, at some future date, are machines—creatures of pure intellect, unencumbered by the prejudices and fallibilities that have traditionally bedeviled rulers of human flesh and blood (Floridi, 2013)? These AI philosopher-kings would differ from their human forebears in their ability to process vast amounts of data, learn from all of human history, and model possible futures with unprecedented accuracy (Moravec, 1988). They could thus, in theory, make decisions not based on short-term gains or emotional predispositions but rather on the long-term flourishing of human civilization and the universe itself (Kurzweil, 2005).

But perhaps one thing remains constant, which is whether a machine, even an AI philosopher-king, could ever truly understand the human experience well enough to govern. Or will there always be an element to human governance that requires the human touch—a recognition of the emotional, irrational, and often contradictory nature of human beings (Damasio, 1999)?

**The Role of Human Wisdom**\
Human wisdom definitely cannot be ruled out by intelligent machines. For all the advances of silicon-and-energy machines, there is something uniquely valuable in the human experience: to be able to empathize, imagine, or make decisions not based on logic alone but on compassion and understanding (Nussbaum, 2001).

The future of governance could not be about machines ruling humans or humans ruling machines but finding that middle-ground system in which human wisdom and machine intelligence work together. Machines, with their huge processing power and predictive capabilities, might lead human society to unprecedented efficiency and prosperity. It is the humans, though, in both their lived experience, ethical framing, and emotional intelligence, who provide the grounding through which governance can be just and compassionate, therefore meaningful (Wolfe, 2010).

**Governance in a Posthuman Condition**\
Entering the post-human era, we would face questions of not merely who should rule but also how we should rule; the eventual form this system of governance takes will likely be quite alien from what anyone has seen to date. The lines that separated the human and machine as ruler and ruled would blur and fade (Hayles, 1999).

It will need us to rethink not just our political systems but also our deeply philosophical assumptions regarding power, intelligence, and agency (Wiener, 1988). As Francis Fukuyama contemplatively predicted, the "end of history" may indeed coincide with the solving of the great technical problems of our age and pass beyond the ideological struggles of the past (Fukuyama, 2002). But perhaps this is not the end at all—perhaps, rather, it is the beginning of a new era, one in which governance is not about dominance or control but about collaboration, wisdom, and mutual flourishing of both humans and machines (Clark, 2003).

And in this future, who should rule? Perhaps the answer is no one—or rather, everybody. Perhaps governance itself will become a shared project, a collaborative activity in which human judgment and machine intelligence come together in such a way that the resulting system serves not one species alone but all conscious life forms, biological and artificial, within this wondrous and still quite mysterious universe (Clark, 2003).
